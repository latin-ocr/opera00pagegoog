will be impossible. The special interest for us lies in the lines which give so

1-8. You ‘zoili not stay modestty at home, my book? Then be off ,· but you
wilt be sorry for it. 1. Vertumnum: the god of the annus vertens (cf.
Colum. 10. 308; Prop. 4. 2. 11), and also possessed of the power to change
himself into any form that he pleased, and so the god of exchange and traffic
(praeses rerum vertendarum Porph.) His temple was in the Vicus Tuscus,
one of the busiest streets in Rome, full of all kinds of shops, and also of
houses of ill repnte. Ianum ι Richter takes this of an arch at the end of
the Vicus Tuscus where it entered the Forum (Top. v. Rom. 802). spec-
tare, ‘ to have your eyes upon‚' with wistful longing. 2. scilicet, ‘of course '

“di'r‘onically, giving the reason in the book’s mind. prostes, ‘be offered for
sa1e‚' not without a double entendre. Sosiorum: freedmen of the family of the
Sosii ; mentioned as booksellers also A. P. 345. pumice, ‘ after the volumen
was completed and rolled up, both ends of the closed roll were smoothed and
polished with pumice ' Munro, Oriticisms of CatulluS, 54 ; cf. Ca-t‘. 1. 1 quoi
dono tepidumm libellum'T arido modo pumice expolitum? Ov. Trist. 1. 1.
11 nec frayili yeminae poliantur pumice fronte&- Mart. 8. 72. 1 nondum
murice cultus avidoque Ι morsu pumicis aridi politus. 3. claves: books
not offered for sale were kept in locked and sometimes sealed cases (εςσνίἷηίὶι)Χχ«ι
or chests (armarii), usually of cedar to keep off moths; cf. Mart. 1.
66. 5-7 secreta quaere carmina et rudes curas Ι quas novit unus scrinioque
siynatas Ι custodit ipse viryinis pater chartae, where an unpublished poem
is compared to a young girl, as here to a boy. Menander speaks of keep-
ing a wife not only barred, but even scaled up: ὅστις δέ μοχλοῖς καὶ διὰ
σφραγισμάτων Ι σώζει δάμαρτα, δρᾶν τι δὴ δοκῶν σοφόν, Ι μάταιός ἐστι καὶ

ε φρονῶν οὐδὲν φρονεῖ. 4. paucis: S. 1. 4. 73. ostendi gemis: for

5. fuge, ‘be off to where . . . (but remember) there will be no return for
you.' For suyere can mean simply ‘to hurry off ' or ‘away'3 cf. Seneca,
Epist. 108. 25 numquam Veryitius dies dicit ire, sed fugere, quod currendi
yenus concitatissimum est. Others explain ‘ shun the place you long to go t0‚
for remember there is no return.' But, as this is a valedictory addreSS, and
as Horace in lines 19 seq. gives his book a commission to discharge, it seems
quite necessary that he should express somewhere his assent, however re-
luctantly‚ to its departure. descendere: regular word for going down
into the Forum. 6. emisso: cf. 1. 18. 71. ’7. quid volui? cf. Virg.

’θ’ Ecl. 2. 58 heu heu! quid votui misego mihi? ubi quid: ΠΒ. authority
is wholly in favour of quid, though most editors read quis, referring to amator.
laeserit still keeps up the double reference; cf. Ov. Her. 5. 103 nulla ‘repa-
rabilis arte Ι laesa pudicitia est. Β. in breve te cogi: applied to the
book: ‘that you areroll'ed up and replaced in your case ’ ; in reference to
the young slave: ‘ that you are brought into sad straits.' Of. Ter. Haut. 4.
