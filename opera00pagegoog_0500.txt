472 HORACE ¹ 130οΚ 11

autumnos nocentem Ι corporibus metuemus Austrum. The unhealthy season
did not affect. Horace in his mountains. acerbae is often of death, esp.
‘untimely death.7 ’

20. Matutine pater, ‘ father of the morning.' J anus, who gets this title
only in this place, is so called because he was the god of all beginnings—of
the beginning of the day, as well as of the year. audis, ‘hearest thyself
called‚' like ἀκούεις, κλύειςτ four times in Horace in this sense, 2. 7. 101 ; Ep.
1. 16. 17 tu recte vivis si curas esse quod audis ,· Ep. 1. 7. 37 rexque paterque Ι
audisti coram. Milton, P. L. iii. 7, 1111113163 1116 idiom ‘ Or hearest thou
rather pure etherea] stream.' Iane: Ianus might be expected3 the very
vocative used is given instead 3 it might be printed in inverted commas This
is not a parallel case to attractions of the nom. to a voc., as PerS. 3. 29 cen-
soremve tuum vel quod trabeate salutas, etc. 21. primos labores operum
vitaeque is the construction—a confused one at the best—‘ the first labours
of their daily life.' 22. tu : emphatic. Horace most happily selects J anus
as the god he is to address: first, he is the god of all beginnings 3 secondly,
he introduces at 01106 by mentioning him the duties of early morning at Rome,
the most irksome time of 1116 whole day, thus at the very outset setting off
his subject by a strong contrast.

23. Romae, ‘ at Rome,’ most emphatic by position. sponsorem, ‘as
a security’ for some friend in a legal difficulty. rapis: sc. 11110 001111;
ἵζέξῖέθὲηᾱέἴξέδοέῗίῗῐὲἰῗω ᾒῗξῗὸέέέὶέῗῃθέ Ξῗὲῃὲῗῧοὶοῃὲθῇἳὲἒῗῗὲ
Juv. 3. 130 ne prior Albinam et Modiam colteya salutet. urgue, ‘ make
haste.' For the intrans. use, cf. the common employment of παῦεε ‘ stop.' 26.
interiore gyro, ‘a narrower circle ’3 cf. Cic. de N. D. 2. 106 nam cursu in-
teriore brevi convertitur orbe. The sun is described 33 moving in circles, which
get smaller up to the winter 30131106 (bruma=brevima). trahit, ‘drags on,'
of the tediousness of winter days. 27. postmodo, quod r‘ni obsit, ‘ what
may one day do me 3 hurt,'.when his friend, 101· instance,'‘should Tan, and his
security should be forfeited. It is better 10 J'oin postmodo 'with obsit, on
account of Od. 1. 28. 31, 1116 only other place where Horace uses the word,
nocituram Ι postmodo te natis This seems to be quite decisive, though most
join it with luctandum. There was a proverb attributed to Bias, ἐγγύα
πάρα δῖ ἄτα (‘give 'your bond for another, and woe is at your door ') 3 and so
Epicharmus in a troch. tetram. ἐγγύα θυγάτηρ μὲν ἄτας ἐγγύας δὲ ζημία. Of.
Prov. xi. 15 ‘he that is surety :for a stranger shall sinart for-it: au‘d he that
hateth suretiship is sure.’ clare certumque locuto : evidently derived
from the very words of a legal formula which commanded a sponsor to give his
promise in a loud and clear voice. certum, adverbially 3 cf. Od. 1. 22. 23 11.

29. quid Vis, insane: the best MSS. read quid tibi vis, which gives
half a foot too much, and Bentley kept this, altering quas res to quam
rem} but most omit tihi. Palmer suggests quid tibi vis, asine, . . .
quas res agis? ‘ what are you driving at ’ζ’ inprobus, ‘ a rude
fellow.' .30. precibus, ‘curses' 3 cf. Epod. 5. 86 Thyesteas preces.
pulses, better, perhaps, not as a question, and so satirically ‘ yngggust of

course knock over everything in our way should you be hurrying ' etc. '‘'3'23
hoe-am. aecenatem r'e''c' umere, or ‘ffle 'fflct‘that they knowI am hurrying to
the house of Maecenas.' atras, on account of the burials which once took

place there, 1. 8. 11 3661113 slightly bad taste in the poet to remind Maecenas of
the fact. 34. ante secundam: before seven o’clock, or thereabouts. Banks
