262. neo nun0=ne nunc quidem, ‘not even now.' Madvig has laid downv
that nc nunc is not used for ne nunc quidem in good authorS, but that nec
nimo is: de Fin. ed. 3, p. 82: excursus pp. 803 seq. nec has much better
authority here than ne. vocet : there is not reason to change this to vocat
against the MSS„ though Terence has arcessor. Cicero always uses nunc cum
with subj. where the clause, while designating time, also implies a reason for
the principal acti0n=‘now that ' ; ay. Cic. Mur. 3. 6 nunc curn omnes one
causae ad misericordiam . . . vocent. See on 1. 3. 121. ultro, ‘goes out of
her way to invite me ' : not only is willing to receive me, but actually invites
me. 263. finire dolores: by conquering my passion. 264. redeam:
deliberative subjunctive. 266. habet, ‘admits of.' 271. insanire . . .
ratione modoque, ‘to go mad by rule and method': cf. Hamlet 11. ii.
, 207 ‘ Though this be madness, yet there is method in ’t.’

272. Picenis . . . pomis ε 0110 of the follies of lovers was to try to hit
the ceiling (cameram) with apple-pips: if they succeeded their love was re-
turned. Picenian apples were one of the best kinds: cf. J uv. 11. 74 aemula
Picenis: see 2. 4. 70. « Picens is used of the inhabitants, Picenus of things,
273. percusti :percussisti : cf. 1. 5. 79 11. penes te es, ‘are you 111
your senses‘2’ lit. ‘ are you in your own possession? thus corresponding exactly
to the Greek σαυτοῦ εἶναι, γενέσθαι. 274. There is no fool like an old
fool. balba . . . verba are the lisping words of lovers: hence Horace
gives the name Balbinus to a doating lover 1. 3. 40. feris perhaps: ‘coin,'
like κόπτειν. · cf. Juv. 7. 55 communi feriat carmen triviale moneta. Orelli 4
and Kiessling explain verba aere feriendo reddis balba, referring to passages
in which voice is said to be produced by striking the air, e. 9. Diog. L. 7. 1. 15
φωνὴ ἀὴρ πεπληγμένος. but this is very recondite. 275. qui, ‘,'how ‘in
what respect’ ε cf. lines 108, 241.

275. adde cruorem: not only the follies of lovers, but the bloodshed
that love leads to——murders and suicides—convince us that it is madness.
276. ignem gladio scrutare, ‘stir fire with a sword' ; the reference is to
the Pythagorean precept πῦρ μαχαίρᾳ μὴ σκαλεύειν. explained Athen. 10. 452
ἀντὶ τοῦ τεθυμωμένον ἄνδρα μὴ ἐριδαίνειν· πῦρ ’γὰρ ὁ θυμός, ἡ δὲ ἔρις μάχαιρα.
modo, ‘lately,’ to take an instance that happened the other day. was Marius
mad when, after stabbing HellaS, he threw himself out of a window. ² Marius
was evidently a Roman, who was driven by his love for Hellas (a freedwomau,
or slave, to judge by her name) to murder her, and commit suicide. The
other arrangement of the passage first put forward by Voss, and preferred by
many editors, is iynem yladio scrutare modo, inquam, taking niodo with the
imperative, as often in Plautus and Terence, in such phrases as vide modo,
cave modo, perqe modo .· ‘just stir the fire with a sword.' 278. cerritus,
‘ crazed‚' an old word of uncertain derivation, perhaps for cerebritus. The
ancients connected it with Ceres, and Kiessling gives ‘possessed by Cerrus '
(cf. laruatus, lymphatus) an old name of a creative (cf. creo) deity, who in a
fem. form is Ceres. 280. ex more, according to common usage. cog·-
nata, ‘related‚' i. e. nearly the same, in the view of the philosopher ε 0110
name, insanus would have done.

281. Damasippus or Stertinius passes on to another phase of madness, viz.
superstition, of which he gives two instanceS. libertinus : a freedman was
a libertus with reference to his patron ; libertinus, with reference to his ordo.
