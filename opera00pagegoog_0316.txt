motionless bulk in artistic contrast to mare ventosum. So 1. 34. 9 brata tellus)
(vayaflnmina. 46. urbe‘s regnaque tristia, ‘cities (of the living) and
realms of gloom.’ Horace elsewhere (2. 20. 5 urbes relinquam ,· 1. 35. 10
urbesque gentesque) uses urbes without any adj. = ‘the world,’ ‘the haunts of
men‚' and so here, for the sake of brevity and to avoid too numerous adjectives‚
he boldly places it by itself in contrast to the ‘realms of gloom.' In English
however we must add some qualifying words for the sake of clearneSS. N otice
that et Joins temperat with regit, and that regit governs all the accusatives from
urbes’. 48. aequo, ‘impartial ' 3 emphatic by position.

49. magnum illa. terrorem . . . The lines from here to the end are
inconsistent with lines 42-48. After reading how as sole ruler of the universe
Jove had annihilated the Titans‚ we are not prepared for the sudden statement
that he had really quaked for fear, and would indeed, but for the firm front
displayed by some subordinate deities, have fared badly. Horace, however,
is thinking not of Jove but of the dangerous opposition which Augustus
had overcome. 50. fidens . . . bracchiis, ‘that band of youth
confident in (the horror of) its upraised arms.' fidens governs bracchiis,
but, as Wickham says, ‘ Horace intends by the collocation of horrida to
give the force of fidens bracchiis quibus horrebat? horrida is used partly:
‘bristling' in reference to the innumerable arms with which some giants
‘ bristled ' (line 69 centimanus Gyas) and to the forest of arms so upraised (cf.
horridi 3. 29. 22), partly in its derivative sense=‘fearfu1 ' in reference to the
effect produced on Jove. 51. fratres. Otus and Ephialtes ; cf. Virg. G.

as to employ it as a means of scaling heaven. Cf. 1. 1. 4 colkyisse iuvat ; 3.

stanza Horace dwells upon the attributes of Apollo which set his beauty and
dignity in effective contrast to the monstrous Titans. ’ For Apollo with the
bow cf. the Homeric epithets applied to him, ἑκατηβόλος, κλυτότοξος, and in
Latin Arcitenens ,· the famous statue of the Apollo Belvidere at Rome repre-
sents him as the ideal of manly beauty. ·
