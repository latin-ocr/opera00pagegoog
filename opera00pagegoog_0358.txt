330 HORAOE Book 1v

can only apply to the triumphator or the triumpha] procession. But Horace
has been referring to Antonius all through as taking the lead in the praise of
Augustus: you, he says, shall sing ansar’s fame, I will Join in (accedet).
Surely then he can speak of him as ‘taking the lead ' (procedo expressing his
‘going in front ' of Horace and the 113111 of citizens in the procession, and
suggesting his ‘taking the lead ' in singing the triumpha] hymn) when Horace
and the rest of the state join in celebrating Caesar's triumph. MSS. give
teque, dum procedis, where 10 13 referred 10 Triumphe, Triumphus being per-
sonified (cf. Epod. 9. 21 io Triumphe, tu moraris aureos currus), and procedis
referring 10 the advance of the procession. ‘Thee will we proclaim as thy
procession passes by, Ηο Triumphi again and again Ho Triumph ζ’ The
objection to this rendering is the difficulty of referring 10 10 any one but
Antonius. Antonius has been addressed in the second person in lines 2, 26,
33, and 41: the 10 31 1110 beginning of this stanza is followed by 10 111 311
exactly parallel position at the commencement of the next stanza, and as
Horace is specially fond of making his meaning clear by placing guiding words,
especially pronouns‚ in emphatic positions, 10 111 11110 53 points back to 10 111
11110 49 33 positively as concines in line 41 does to concines in 11110 33. Μο10-
over, the whole of the latter part of the Ode is an elaborate antithesis between
Antonius and Horace: ‘Thou hast an important part,' Horace keeps repeat—
ing, '‘ I a humble one' ; and the whole symmetry and balance of this is marred
by the introduction of an emphatic ‘ Thon, O Triumph ! ' 11110 1110 middle of it.

54. solvet, ‘ shall set free,' i. 0. from my vow. Horace vitulum voverat
pro reditu Auyusii ; Augustus having returned, he becomes voti reus, ‘ respon-
sible for his vow ’ 3 the offering of the calf would ‘ set him free from his vow ' 3
cf. 2. 17. 30 n. 56. in mea vota, ‘to pay my vow.' 57. fronte,
‘with its forehead,’ which with the young horns growing on it is said to
imitate ‘the moon's crescent fire as she brings round her third rising,' i.e. the
third after the new moon. 59. qua notam duxit, ⁶ where it has got (or
acquired) a mark.' niveus videri: λευκὸς ι’δεῖν, cf. 1. 3. 25 11. 11 1133
been urged that there is considerable bathos in this Ode, which began with
Pindar and ends with the description of a calf, but the penultimate stanza
carries on 111 311 exceedingly natural manner the comparison between Antonius'
greatness and the humbleness of Horace, while the repose and simplicity of
the last stanza are quite in accordance with the poet's practice of allowing >a
nervous and brilliant Ode 10 sink into quiet and calm at its conclusion.
