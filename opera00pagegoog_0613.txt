the indic. is given in all MSS. But if Horace had meant, as most editors say,
‘the wise man‚’ could he have used the indicative? The poet rather denotes
himself, ‘ Ι know one at least who does not care to have.' So Conington and

mortalis: viewed in itself, and as a part of the divinity which rules the
universe, the genius is immortal, as Apuleius says (de deo Socr. c. 15) is deus,
qui est animus suus cuique, quamquam sit immortalis, tamen quodammodo cum
homine yiy‘nitur. But as regards the individual (in unum quodque caput)
it is mortal, and on the death of the man to whom it is attached, it returns
into the universal soul of the world. Some Stoics believed that all souls
existed independently until the end of the world’s course, when they would be
resolved into the Divine Being ; others that only the souls of the wisc retained
for a time this independent existence. The notion that the genius of the
individual is a part of the World-soul explains how it can be regarded as
