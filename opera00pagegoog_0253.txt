Cf. Anacreon fr. 52 ἀγανῶς οἷά τε νέβρον νεοθηλέα Ι γαλαθηνόν, ὅστ’ ἐν ὕλῃς
’ κεροέσσης Ι ἀπολειφθεὶς ὑπὸ μητρὸς ἐπτοήθη.

4. siluae. · trisyllabic (cf. Epod. 13. 23 16. 32), the Roman V being a
semivowel. 5. nam seu . . ‘for whether the arrival (= first breath)
01· spring has shivered among the quivering leaves . . . veris adventus
implies the thought of the gentle zephyr which accompanies it; cf. Lucr. 5.
736 it ver et Venus et veris praenuntius ante Ι pennatus yraditur Zephyrus,
inhorruit beautifully expresses the shivering and quivering of the leaves as
the breeze rustles through them. Bentley and others obJ‘ect to these exquisite
lines because, they say, when ⁶ spring arrives ' the trees are not yet in leaf.
For veris adventus some actually print vepms ad ventos-a correction the
mechanica] ingenuity' of which is as marvellous as it is misplaced.

8. tremit, sc. inuisus. For the thought cf. Spenser, ‘ Like as a hind
. . . Yet fiies away of her own feet affear'd; Ι And every leaf that shaketh
with the least Ι Murmur of wind, her terror hath encreas’d.’ 9. atqui:
a very favourite word of Horace in beginning a stanza, and expressing a
strong obJ‘ection, remonstrance or antithesis, cf. 3. 5. 493 7. 9. tigris
aspera, ‘ enraged tigress.' 10. frangere. Epexegetic inf. aster persequor
implying desire3 1. 15. 27 n. 11. matrem . . . ‘to cling to your

ODE XXIV

Addressed to Virgil by Horace on the unexpected death of their common
friend Quintilius Varus. of Quintilius (probably Quintilius Varus, cf. 1.
18. 1 ; A.P. 438) our chief knowledge is that he died in B.c. 24, and was a
native of Cremona, but his name is enshrined in this Ode for immortality.

1. desiderio. In its strict sense, ‘ regi-et for loss? pudor, ‘ shame,'
‘ moderation‚' almost equivalent to modu3‚· cf. line 6 n. 2. cari capitis,
‘so dear a life.’ Of. the Gk. use of κάρα 111 such phrases as ὣ φίλον κάρα.
3. Melpomene. Usually the Muse 01· tragedy, here of dirges.

5. ergo. admirationis cum maerore coniunctae exclamatio, Orelli. ‘ And

so the sleep that knows no waking 1108 heavy on Quintilius l ' Cf. S. 2. 5.
101 ; Virg. Ecl. 1. 47 smanate senex, erqo tua rwra manebunt? Ov. Trist.
3. 2. 1 erqo erat in fatis? For perpetuus see 1. 7. 6 n., and for p. sopor,
of the ‘ unbroken sleep ' of death, Catullus 5. 5 soles occidere et redire possunt ,-
Ι nobis oum semel occidit brevis lux, Ι nox esi perpetua una dormientia ,-
J ob xiv. 12. For urguet cf. 1. 22. 20, and, used with reference to the dead,
4. 9. 27 inlacrimabiles wryuentur; so too premet ‘nox 1. 4. 16. It is much to
be wished that Horace had omitted the first stanza, with its weak and affected
invocation of the Muse, and begun with this bold and effective fifth line,
which would have been all the more effective at the beginning of the Ode.
6. Pudor, Αἰδώς. The personification of that noble shame which makes men
shrink from all that could raise a blush upon the cheeks of modesty; cf.
C. S. 57. Iustitiae soror, Fides. ‘ In calling Good-Faith the sister of
J ustice, Horace implies that the two go together, and therefore that both
were present in Quintilius.'—Wickham. 7. incorrupta, ‘ incorruptible.’
Adjectives formed from the passive part. and in are frequently used for the
more awkward ones 111-11721αο1. 2. 14. 4 indomitus ‘ unconquerable ' ; Virg.
G. 3. 5 inlaudatus ‘detestable ' ; Livy 2. 1 inviolatum templum ⁶ inviolable ' ;
invictus is more often ‘invincible ' than ‘ unvanquished.' 8. quando
