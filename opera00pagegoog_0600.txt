256. Parthie: cf. Od. 1. 19. 11 n.; O. S. 53. 257. cuperem, attracted into
the tense of possem. 258. recipit, ‘ admits of’ 3 cf. Suet. Aug. 89 inqenia
saeculi sui omnibus modis fovit .· recitantes et beniqne et patienter audivit, nec
tantum carmina et historias, sed et orationes et dialqus'. componi tamen ali-
quid de se nisi serio et a praestantissimis offendebatur, admonebatque praetores,
ne paterentur nomen suum commissionibus (⁶ prize declamatione ') obsolefieri.
For maiestas cf. Od. 4. 15. 15 n. 259. ferre recusent: cf. A. P. 39.

260. stulte, quem diligit, urguet ε stulte must go with urquet and not
with diliqit, for stulte diliqit would. be very inappropriate if referred to Augustus.
262. discit: sc. aliquis, to be supplied from the quis in the relative clause.
People remember a ridiculous poem or a ridiculous portrait more readily
than a good one. Of course there is no reference to intentional caricature.
264. nil moror: Horace puts himself for the moment in the place of the
emperor z ‘ I care nothing—and therefore I am sure that you do not.’ ficto
in peius vultu ε cf. Pliny, Ep. 5. 10 pictores pulchram absolutamque formam
raro nisi in peius effinqunt. 265. proponi cerense, ‘to be exposed as a
waxen image,' i.e. to have a caricatured portrait of myself offered for sale. It
was customary to make the irnaqines of deceased ancestors of wax (Pliny, H.
N. 35. 2. 6 expressi cera vultus sinqulis disponebantur armariis) ; and the art
may naturally have been transferred to living persons of celebrity. 267.
pingui, ‘stupid ' ; cf. S. 2. 6. 14. una cum scriptore meo: Horace
does not seem to mean more than ‘ I should be involved in the disgrace which
will come upon the poet who makes me his theme, when his worthless poem
is sent off to be used for waste paper.' 268. capsa, properly a book-case
(S. l. 4. 22), here humorously put for a bier. porrectus, stretched. out
at length like a corpse. operta: sometimes a corpse was carried out to
burial onan open couch or bier (lectus, feretrum), sometimes in a coffin
(capulus) carried on a frame (sandapila); cf. Marquardt‚ Privatalt. 1. 360,
and the latter was more usual with the poorer classes. Orelli needlessly read
aperta. 269. Vicum, probably the vicus Tuscus of S. 2. 3. 228. 270.

tus ,· which he gets from Catull. 95. 5 Volusi annales . . . lamas scombris
saepe dabunt tunicae. Our modern equivalent is to be found in the trunk-
makers and pastry-cookS. Cf. Martial 6. 60 7 quam multi tineas pascunt
blattasque diserti, Ι et redimunt soli carmina docta coqui.

EPISTLE II

For Florus cf. l. 3 Intr. There is a great similarity of tone between this
Epistle ancl the first of the first book. In both Horace pleads that increasing
years have left him no taste or power for lyric poetry3 and make it a duty
for him to study philosophy. Here he lays stress also on the hindrances
arising from city life, and his disgust at the ‘mutual admiration’ cliques of
contemporary versifiers. The date is probably about 19 B.0.
