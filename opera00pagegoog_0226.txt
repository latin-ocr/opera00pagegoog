198 HORACE Book 1

2. 17 quos Elea domum reducit Ι palma caelestes. For evehoz‘carry up ‘
ef. Virg. Aen. .6. 130 quos . . . ardeus evexit ad aethera virtus.

7. hunc . . . illum : governed by a verb to be supplied from the general
sense of iuvat and evehit. Some place a full-stop after uobiZi3‚ making hunc
and illum in apposition to terrarum dominos, which they explain of the
Romans as opposed to the Greeks already mentioned—‘ the lords of the world
it exalts to heaven, one if . . . another if . . . ’ But a full-stop at the end
of the first line of a stanza is very awkward, while, if Nauck's arrangement
of the stanzas be right, there cannot be a full-stop after nobilis 8.
tergeminis honoribUS‚ ‘ triple magistracies‚' i.e. the curule aedileship,
praetorship, and consulship, the three great offices which were the object of
Roman ambition.

10. Libycis. The corn-land of Italy, which was continually decreasing
owing to the increase of parks, vineyards‚ and pasture-lands, was yearly be-
coming more and more inadequate to supply the requirements of Rome, which
depended largely for its supplies on Africa (cf. 3. 16. 31; S. 2. 3. 87), Egypt,
and Sicily, much as England now becomes yearly more dependent on Ameriea
or India: cf. 2. 15. 1 11. 12. Attalicis c. ‘terms such as an Attalus
could offer.' The wealth of tthese kings of Pergamus was proverbial: of. 2.
18. 5. 13. demoveas. The 2nd person sing. used indefinitely= ‘any
one.' We should say ‘no one would ever move . .

13-15. cypria . . . Myrtoum . . . Icariis . . . Ad-ffium. Notice
carefully Horace's fondness for specialising general words such as ‘ship‚’
‘ sea,' ‘waves,’ ‘wind‚' by giving to each ‘a local habitation and a name’:
the effect is to give definiteness and reality. N umerous instances occur in
almost every Ode. 14. pavidus : ‘ trembling ' because of his inexperience,
which would make him exaggerate the dangers.

18. indocilis pati. See 1. 3. 25 11. pauperiem, ‘humble circumstances ':
cf. 1. 12. 43 n. and 3. 16. 37 n. 20. partem solido demere de die.
Solidus (ef. solus, 6x05)=that which is whole, entire: hence dies solidus,
that part of the day which should not be broken into, the working part
of the day. Cf. Sen. Ep. 83 hodiernus dies solidus οδω nemo ex illo mihi
quidquam eripuit. The next two lines show that the reference is to taking
a long siesta at noon. 21. membra stratus, ‘his limbs stretched’ 3 cf.
S. 1. 1. 5 11. 22. lene caput, ‘the gentle source.' The water flows
gently and soothes him to sleep. 23. lituo tubae. The tuba was straight
and used by the infantry, the lituus curved and used by the cavalry.
Lucan 1. 237 stridor lituum clamorque tubarum, ⁶ shriek of horns and braying
of trumpets‚' illustrates their sound.

25. detestata, ‘ abhorred.' The verb is deponent, but for convenience
the part. is allowed a passive sense, cf. Epod. 5. 39 interminatus; 16.
8 abominatus; S. 2. 2. 114 metatus ‚· 2. 2. 124 veneratus ,0 modulatus,
meditatus, etc. sub Iove frigido, ‘beneath the cold heaven. ' Jupiter
is the god of the bright sky, and sub Iove=sub divo or sub dio, 3. 2. 5.
This is clear from the etymology, Iuppiter being=Diupater from a root DIV
(whence dim-3, diem, Ζεύς, Διός 01· ΔιῈος) which indicates ‘brightness'3 cf.
Diespiter 1. 34. 5 and 3. 2. 29, 28. teretes. See 2. 4. 21 n. The cords
are not rough or loosely made but neatly twisted‚ ‘ shapely‚' and so strong.

29. me. The pronoun put first marks the transition from the pursuits of
other men to that which Horace makes the obJect of his ambition. hederae :

ivy was sacred to Bacchus, and so, he being the god of inspiration (2. 19.
