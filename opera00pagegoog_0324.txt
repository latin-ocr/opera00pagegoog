5. docte . . . ‘O Maecenas, learned in the lore of either tongue,' τῖε.
for all your knowledge of Greek and Roman folk-lore, you cannot find any
tale or legend which accounts for my treating to-day as a festival. ser-
mones, λόγους, ‘ old tales,' handed down by word of mouth, in connexion
with popular customs and holidays. The word is clearly distinguished from
linguae, and therefore the rendering ‘learned in the speech of either tongue '
must be wrong, apart from the fact that (1) it does not explain the plural
semones and (2) is an unmeaning compliment. utriusque linguae: so
Cic. de off. 1. 1. 1 ut par sis iu utriusque orationis facultate. The Romans
habitually read and used Greek, but ignored other languages: hence ‘ either
tongue ’ :Greek and Latin. 6. album Libero caprum. The ‘ goat ’ was
sacrificed to Bacchus because it does great damage to vineyards. Black victims
were offered to the gods below, white ones to the gods above. For Bacchus

10. corticem . . . ‘ shall remove the cork fastened down with rosin
from a jar (first) taught to drink the smoke in 'Pullus’ consulship! Wine

1. 20. 3 ; Theocr. 7. 147 τετράενες δὲ πίθων ἀπελύετο κρατὸς ἄλειφαρ), labelled
with its name and that of the consuls of the year, and then, if early maturity
was desired‚ placed in the apotheca (ἀποθήκη = ‘ bodega '), an upper room which
received a good deal of warmth and smoke from the bath furnaces. Cf. 3. 21.
7, where Horace says to a ,jar descende, τῖε. from the apotheca. 11. bibere
institutae, ‘taught to drink‚' a half-comio expression, cf. funeratus above.
12. Tullo. L. Volcatius Tullus was consul Rc. 66, the year before Horace's
birth. cf. 3. 21. 1 ο nata mecum consule Manlio . . . testa, and 3. 14. 18,
where he speaks of cadum Marsi memorem duelli, the Marsic war having taken
place B.c. 88. Wine was kept for great and even incredible periods ι Martial

alludes to people in his day (flor. 90 A.D.) drinking Opimianum, Opimius
having been consul B.c. 121.

13. cyathos amici sospitis, ‘cups (in honour) of your friend's safety.'
cyathus (see Dict. Ant.) is strictly a small ladle used in mixing3 it is
here used genera11y=‘a cup! For construction of amici sospitis see 3. 19.
9 n. 14. centum: indefinite, cf. 2. 14. 26. et vigiles . . . ‘carry
on the sleepless lanterns to the dawn.' Cf. 3. 21. 23. 1'7. mitte . . .
‘lay aside a statesman's anxieties for the city.' civiles is merely ‘publia'
