ODE XXIX

‘ Are you really, Iccius, intending to Join the expedition to Arabia? What
can you hope to quin 2 Surely the world must bo upside down when the
philosophie Iccius selis his caresully smmed ἰῶν-ατη to buy armour!

1. Ioci ε see Ep. 1. 12 Intr. beatis gazis, ‘rich treasureS.’ The word
yet-za is Persian. Arabia Felix or Sabaea was celebrated for precious persumes‚
cf. the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, 1 Kings x. 1. For its
‘ treasures' cf. 2. 12. 24 plenas Arabum domos ,· 3. 24. 1 intactis opulentior
thesauris Arabum; Ps. lxxii. 15 ‘unto him shall be given of the gold of
Arabia.’ To 1116 Romans the East was a land of untold wealth‚ an Eldorado
such as the Spaniards hoped to find in Mexico and Peru ε 111 both cases the
first explorers were dazzled by vast collections of useless wealth formed
by a few despotic potentateS, while the inhabitants starved. Cf. Milton,
P. L. 2. 3 ‘Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand Ι Showers on her
kings barbaric pearl and gold.’ 4. regibus, ‘ emirS,’ ‘ princes.'

5. nectis catenas. The whole stanza is 111 3 10116 of playsul irony:
Horace exaggerates the expectations of Iccius. He speaks of him as forging
fetters, and hoping to bring home the captives of his bow and spear in heroic
fashion. quae tibi . . . ‘what barbarian maid will be your slave when
you have slain her betrothed ’ζ’ Cf. Judges v. 30 ‘Have they 1101 sped?
have they not divided the prey: to every man a damsel or two . . . ’ζ’
’7. puer . . . ‘what page from court with persumed looks will be set to
hand your cup ’ἐ ’ For these Eastern cup-bearers cf. Nehem. ii. 1 ; Dan. i. 3.
They were usually of noble birth and persona] beauty. capillis: cf.
Tennyson’s ‘long-haired page ' in the Lady of Shalott.

9. Sericas. The Seres are the remotest people of the East. Ν 01106 how
Horace started with Arabia, soon got to Parthia (Medo), and has now made
Iccius reach China. Perhaps the exaggeration is intended. 10. quis
neget . . . ‘who would deny 11131 descending streams can flow backwards
up steep mountains . . . ’ζ’ arduis montibus ε abl. abs. on the analogy
of adverso flumine etc„ or possibly dative of place whither. The phrase is
common to express that the order of nature is inverted ; cf. Eur. Med. 440
ἅνω ποταμῶν ἱερῶν χωροῦσι παγαί, Ι καὶ δίκα, καὶ πάντα πάλιν στρέφεται,
and Cicero, ad Att. 15. ι4. 1, merely writes ἄνω ποταμῶν when 116 wishes to
say ‘all is topsy-turvy.' Notice the juxtaposition of the antithetical words
arduis pronos, and the accommodation of sound to sense in line 11 with its
heavy uphill movement.

13. coemptos undique. He was not merely 311 ordinary student of
philosophy, but a keen collector of philosophical works. For the p in
coemptos cf. 2. 4. 10 11. 14. Panaeti. A Stoic philosopher, a friend of
Scipio and Laelius, died about 111 Ec. Socraticam domum, ‘the
Socratic school‚' ie. the works of the Socratic school. The phrase would
include all those philosophers (6.9. Peripatetics‚ Cynics, Cyrenaics) who were
influenced by Socrates, and, chief among them, Plato, Friedrich (Philolog.
Untersuchungen‚ 1894, p. 156) argues that there was no ‘Socratic school‚'
for Socrates merely encouraged a spirit of philosophie inquiry generally and
laid down no dogmas ; he renders ‘your Socratic house,’ cf. C. ad Quintum
3. 1. 5 ea villa . . . tamquam philosopha videtur esse, of a simple country·
house. 15. Hiberis: made of Spanish steel.
