ODE XXX

. ‘ Venus, quit thy favourile hau'nts to visit Glycera who prays thy presence,
and lm'nq with. thee chy joyous troop of attendants?

1. Cnidus, in Caria: here was the famous statue of Venus by Praxiteles,
of which the Medicean is said to be a copy. 2. sperne. Cf. 1. 19. 9.
4. in aedem. Aedes in sing. =‘a temp1e‚' in plur.=‘a house.' Perhaps
Glycera is supposed to have fitted up a mimic shrine for Venus, and Horace
wrote this mimic ode of invocation (ᾆσμα κλητικόν) for the occasion. This
view is supported by the words ture multo, Kiessling says that the coming
of the goddess will make the ‘ house ’ a ‘temple’ 5. solutis zonis, ‘ with
loosened girdles.’ For the position of quein Gratiae properentque Nymphae
see 2. 19. 28 n. 7. parum comis . . . ‘youth that without thee (i.e.
Love) loses all its charm.' 8. Mercurius accompanies Venus as the god
of speech: silent wooers are rarely successful.

ODE XXXI

‘ What shall the poet pray for lo his patron qod Apollo on this yreal day?
Nol for larye estates and wealth. Let wealth ancl luxuriosos livinq be for
prosperous merehanls, who think themselves the very favourites os heaven
because their ships have made many successful voyage& I am salisfied with
simple fare, and ask but for a healtlzy mind and healtlzy body, an old aye free
from dishonour and charmed by poetry?

For the temple of Apollo Palatinus, dedicated Β. 0. 28, see note on Ep. 1. 3. 17.

1. dedicatum=‘in his new ‘temple' The Romans can say not merely
dedicare aedem, but dedicare deum,· Wickham well says, ‘ perhaps from the
image of the god which was installed in his shrine.' In this case we know

’ that the image was a statue by Scopas which Augustus brought from Greece

(Plin. 36. 5. 4). Propertius describes it (3. 23. 5)‚, and a copy of it, the
‘Apollo Citharoedus,’ is in the Vatican, and is represented in Smith’s Hist.
of Greece, pp. 551, 580. 2. novum. Cf. 1. 19. 15 bimi meri. New wine
was used in libations. 4. Sardiniae. Both Sardinia and Sicily supplied
Rome with corn ; cf. 1. 1. 10 n. segetes feraces: ‘fruitful crops’ or
‘ fruitful corn-lands.' se9e3=either the land sown, or the crop.

5. aestuosae, ‘sultry ἐ ef. 1. 22. 5. grata: as being in good condi-
tion, and pleasant to contemplate. Calabria was famous especially for winter
grazing3 cf. Ep. 2. 2. 177 n. ; Epod. 1. 27. 6. aurum aut ebur Indi-
cum. Gold and ivory are taken as typical of Oriental wealth and luxury
generally. So the navy of Tharshish (1 Kings x. 22) brought to Solomon
every three years ⁶ gold, and silver‚ and ivory.’ 7. quae Liris . . .
‘ which Liris eats away with his gentle waters‚ that silent stream? The
beauty of the description of a slowly-flowing river is, in the Latin, incompar-
able. quieta: of the slow movement of the stream, taciturnus of the
consequent silence of its waters, cf. the opposite loquaces 3. 13. 15.

9. premant, ‘ prune ': repress the luxuriant growth of. Calena.
The epithet is transferred from the vine to the pruning-knife3 hypallage,
cf. 3. 1. 42 n. Cales is in Campania. 10. dives ut . . . ‘that the

rich merchant may drain from golden goblets wines acquired in exchange for
(reparata) Syrian merchandise.' culilli are said to be vessels used in sacred
