has poor authority and is unsuited to the passage, in which there is no mockery.

19. mihi, ‘for my own profit.' hoc, ‘this conduct of mine,’ not re-
ferring to the latter of the two alternatives, but to that which is nearer to the
thought of the speaker. Cf. S. 2. 2. 29. 20. equus ut me portet:
Bentley first showed that this goes with officium facio, not as previous editors
had taken it with est. The phrase was proverbial in Greek. ἵππος με φέρει,
βασιλεύς με τρέψειε cf. Diogen. Paroem. 5. 31, where a certain Corraeus in
service under Philip so answers his mother when she begs him to ask for his
discharge. 21. officium facio, ‘I pay my court’ z for officia 111 this sense
cf. 1. 7. 8 n. Vilia, verum: the reading 01· the 8611011331, supported by
all MSS. of any critical value, and rightly adopted by most editors, as Ritter,
Schiitz and Keller. vilia rerum might be defended by ficta ‘rerum S. 2. 8. 83;
vana rerum S. 2. 2. 25 ; abdita rerum A. P. 49 ; but on the other hand Horace
is fond 01· ending a line with verum3 cf. 1. 1. 80 ; 2. 2. 70 (where some MSS.
have rerum, as here, against the sense), 106; S. 1. 2. 92 ; Α. Ρ. 303 2 hence there
is no reason for departing from the great preponderance 01· authority. The
construction apparently is tu poscis vilia, verum poscis dante minor, i.e. but
in making your demand you place yourself in a position of inferiority to the

bestower. 22. fers, ‘you boast.' nullius is masculine z neminis occurs
in Plaut. Capt. 3. 5. 106, but fell out of use before the time of Cicero.

23. color, ‘form of life ’z S. 2. 1. 60 quisquis erit vilae color. 24.
temptantem, ‘aiming at.’ praesentibus aequum: cf. Od. 3. 29. 33

some take it as abl., ‘content with 1113 present lot? But is there any parallel
to this use of aequus? fere: 1. 6. 9 11. Diog. Laert. 2. 8. 66 says of
Aristippus ἦν ἱκανὸς ἁρμόσασθαι καὶ τόπῳ καὶ χρόνῳ καὶ προσώπῳ καὶ
πᾶσαν περίστασιν ἁρμοδίως ὑποκρίνασθαι · διὸ καὶ παρὰ Διονυσίῳ τῶν ἄλλων

the διπλοΐς 01· the CynicS, a large cloak (abolla) also called τρίβων, worn
doubled to serve at once as a χιτών (tunica) and χλαμύς (pallium). Cf.
Mayor on JUV. 3. 115 audi facinus maioris abollae: Diog. Laert. 6. 22
τρίβωνα διπλώσας πρῶτος, κατά τινας διὰ τὸ ἀνάγκην ἔχειν καὶ ἐνεύδειν αὐτῷ,
πήραν τε ἐκομίσατο. panno, ‘rag, ' ῥάκος, 13 used contemptuously.
patientia: καρτερία( endurance,' like patienter above.

27. alter, sc. Aristippus. 61. Diog. L. 2. 8. 67 διό ποτε Στράτωνα, οἱ δὲ

not its dye, which* is celebrated. cf. Ar. Lys. 729, Ran. 541, Theocr. 15. 125,
etc. cane et angui: the dog and the snake were both regarded as animals
of evil omen ; cf. Ter. Phorm. 4. 4. 24 monstra evenerunt mihi .· Ι introiit in

Stob. Flor. 5. 46 tells a story which admirably illustrates Horace' 3 account 01·
