quidam (so MSS.) . . . dives Ι ut metiretur nummos ‚· 7. 13 ira fuit capitalis, ut
ultima divideret mors. frater is then to be regarded as strongly emphatic by
position, and the sense is: ‘there were once two brothers—a lawyer and a
barrister—-( so brotherly) that 0116 was always complimenting the other.' Many
editors on the other haud regard the construction as indefensible and the line as
corrupt. Bentley suggested pactus erat Romae consulto rhetor, ‘a rhetorician
at Rome had bargaiued with a lawyer.' Meineke thought that a line must
have been lost, owing to the copyist’s eye falling 011 two similar syllables
recurring ; and would read frater erat Romae consulti rhetor, ut [erque Ι alterius
laudum sie admirator ut] alter. Schiitz suggests fautor, which is a favourite
word with Horace in very similar expressions (cf. 1. 15. 33 nequitiae fauto-
ribu33 18. 66 fautor laudabit ; 2. 1. 23 sic fautor veterum ; S. 1. 10. 2 tam
Dacia· fautor), and which perhaps from its meaning might dispense with an
adverb, such as tam before it, like the adjectives quoted above. Palmer pro-
poses auctor erat consulto, ‘ a rhetoriciau proposed to a lawyer.’ 88. meros
honores, ‘ nothing but compliments ’ ε cf. 1. 7. 84. 89. Gracchus :
undoubtedly Gaius, who is praised by Cicero, Brut. 33. 126, as a greater orator
than his elder brother Tiberius ε eloquentia quidem neseio an habuisset parem
neminem. For Mucius see class. Dict. s.v. Scaevola 3 many of the family
were eminent as jurisconsults. foret huic ut Mucius ille z all MSS. have
hic ut Mucius illi, but as early as 1516 this was corrected into the now all
but universally received huic ille. It is impossible to believe that Horace
wrote ut hic illi Gracchus foret, hic ita· Mucius, Keller adduces examples of
hie . . . hie, but none where ille is also used in the passage. This 11116 is one of
the instances in which the archetype was clearly corrupt.

90. qui minus, ‘ in what way less ’.ἱ ’ S. 2. 3. 311 qui ridiculus miuus illo?
7. 96 qui peccas minus atque eqo? Translate ‘and are our tuneful poets less
troubled by this Π16ε1116332’ 91. carmina compono, ‘ Ι am a writer of
lyrics ’ 3 though for the time being Horace had abandoned this form of com-
position, he speaks of it as his most distinctive style. hic, probably
Propertius, who delighted to be regarded as the Roman Callimachus (line 100 ε
cf. Propert. 5. 1. 63-6‚ and see note in separate edition). mirabile . . .
opus ε 611 admiring exclamation of mutual compliment. Bentley obJ'ected (1)
that visu could only be used of external appearance, which is out of the question
here ; (2) that caelatum illusis could only mean ⁴ adorned with figures of Muses’
(as in Ov. Met. 13. 110 caelatus imaqiue mundi). Hence he wished to govern
these words by circum spectemus’, taking them in apposition to aedem. But (1)
mirabile visu had become a stereotyped compound expression for ‘ admirable,'
(2) the construction of caelo with the abl. does not exclude an entirely different
construction with the dat. of the agent. Of. 2. 1. 27. 92. novem t all the
Muses must have had a hand in such an exquisite piece of art! 93.
