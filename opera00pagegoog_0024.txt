xviii HORAGE

The connexion between the third and fourth lines is especially close:
thus there are eight instances of et elided at the end of the third line
(1. 35. 11 barbarorum et {purpurei; 2. 13. 233 3. 1. 393 3. 713 4. 59;
6. 33 29. 3 ; 29. 7) and 2. 35. 39 retusum in Ι Massagetas, whereas only
one such instance occurs in the first two lines, 1. 9. 13 quaerere et Ι quem.
In two instances for the sake of special effect, the third line is actually
connected with the fourth, 2. 3. 27 sors emitura et nos in aeternlum
eaesiZium ,· 3. 29. 35 cum pace delabentis Etrusclum in mare.

ξ 3. In the first two lines a break always occurs after the fifth syllable.
Elision, however, often occurs especially of a syllable ending in m, of
which there are fourteen instances, while there are only five of a vowel
so elided. They only end with a monosyllable once (4. 9. 1 ne sorte
credas interitura quae).

A syllable ending in m is elided 1. 16. 6 sacerdotlum incoZa; 34. 13
insiynlem attenuat; 35. 25; 2. 5. 21; 13. 63 17. 10; 3. 1. 53 3. 413
3. 49; 4. 4 consillium et; 6. 1; 6. 6 principlium ἤτω,- 21. 13; 29. 17.
,Α vowel 1. 34. 10 inviin horrida; 2. 3. 13 un9uentla et,· 3. 2. 5 sub
div'o et,· 4. 6 audirle et ‚· 6. 18 ’ίηφιίηαυενΙε et.

The following five lines are exceptional ε three of them occur in the First
Book, two being in the striking but irregular Cleopatra Ode 3 the fourth
is hardly an exception, while the fifth being found in the extremely formal
and regular Odes of the Fourth Book must be specially intended to
attract attention by its exceptional shape.

1. 16. 21 hostile aratrum ealercitus insolens
1. 37. 5 antehac nefas del promere O'aecubum
1. 37. 14 mentemque lymphlatam Mareotico
2. 17. 21 utrumque nostrum inlcredibili modo
4. 14. 17 spectandus in certlamine Martio.

ἓ 4. The third line bears the weight of the stanza and is very carefully
constructed. These are model lines ε ’

audita Ι Musarum Ι sacerdos visam Ι pharetratos Ι Gelonos
matrona Ι bellantis Ι tyranni tractas Ι et incedis Ι per iynes
descendat Ι in Campum Ι petitor - testatur Ι auditumque Ι Medis
sortitur Ι insiynes Ι et imos apponet Ι annos ; Ι iam protervae

It cannot end with a monosyllable (the exception is 2. 7. 19 depone
sub lauru mea, nec) or a quadrisyllable (the exceptions are 1. 35. 11
{arbitroqum ,· 2. 7. 19 temperatam ,· 2. 19. 19 viperino) or with two

isy lab es,

Two disyllables occur 2. 1. 11 res ordinaris, arande munus ,· 19. 11
cantare rivos atque truncis. In 1. 29. 11 pronos relabi posse rivos a special
effect is aimed at. The five other instances present a marked peculiarity ε
the first disyllable is immediately repeated at the beginning of the fourth
line, the special emphasis given to the repeated word at once restoring
to the third line its sonorous character. The instances are all in the
first two Books: 1. 16. 3 pones iambis sive flamma Ι εὶνθ,..; 1. 26. 7
qaudes, apricos necte flores Ι necte... ; 2. 13. 27 Alcaee, plectro dura
navis Ι dura...; 2. 14. 11 enaviyanda sive reyes Ι sive...; 2. 19. 6
laetatur .· euoe, parce Liber Ι parca...
