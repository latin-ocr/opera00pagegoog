Juv. 3. 166; 7. 69. For modico cf. Ep. 1. 5. 2 modica. patella. Helio·
dorus the rhetor, is not mentioned elsewhere. 3. Forum Appi: sc. mc
cwcepit. This town was in the Pomptine marshes, 20 Roman miles from
Aricia. It was named after Appius Claudius Caecus, who built the Appian
road, see line 6 11. Here St. Paul was met by friends from Rome3 cf. Acts
xxviii. 15. 4. differtum nautis, ‘crammed with sailors,’ i. e. boatmen,
because a canal began here, and ran through the Pomptine marshes as far as
the temple of Feronia, near Anxur; cf. line 12. malignis: they gave short
measure3 cf. 1. 1. 29.

5. hoc iter, ‘this stage‚’ πλε. from Rome to Forum Appi. divisimus,
‘ we broke into two! altius praecinctis, ‘to smarter travalias? εὐζώνῳ
ἀνδρί is regular in Herodotus to describe a fairly quick walker. The expres-
sion here ought naturally to mean that Horace and Heliodorus went on foot
as far as Forum Appi. That is scarcely likely, and probably the words refer
to the lecticarii, the slaves who carried the litterS. So umeris, line 90, though
said of the traveller himself, really refers to the slaves, 6. minus est
gravis Appia tardis, ‘the Appian way is the less tiring to those who travel
slowly ἰ the Appian road is not meant to contrast with other roads in this
respect. If the travellers were in carriages, these, having no springs, would
cause much jolting: if in litters, it is sufficient to suppose the tediousness of
the journey made the way seem gravis. via is often omitted with Appia:
cf. Epod. 4. 14 Appiam mannis terit. The Appian way was built by the
Censor Appius Claudius Caecus, from Rome to Capua, in 312 Re. It was
continued at a later date to Brundisium, it is not known exactly when, or by
whom, but certainly before Horace's time; cf. Ep. 1. 18. 20 Brundisium
Minuci melius via ducat an Appi. Strabo describes the reverse journey to
Rome (cc. 282, 283): δύο δέ εἰσι (ὁδοὶ είς τὴν Ῥώμην), μία μὲν ἡμιονικὴ διὰ
Πευκετίων, οὓς Ποιδίκλους καλοῦσι, καὶ Δαυνίων καὶ Σαυνιτῶν μέχρι Βενεουεν-
τοῦ, ἐφ’ ᾗ ὀδῷ Ἐ’γνατία πόλις εἶτα Καιλία καί Νήτιον καὶ Κανύσιον καὶ
Ἐρδωνία· ὴ δὲ διὰ Τάραντος μικρὸν ἐν ἀριστερᾷ ὅσον δὴ μιᾶς ἡμέρας περίοδον
κυκλεύσαντι, ἡ Ἀππία λεγομένη, ἁμαξηλατος μᾶλλον· ἐν ταύτῃ δὲ πόλις
Οὐρία τε καὶ Οὐενουσία, ’ἦ μὲν μεταξὺ Τάραντος καὶ Βρεντεσίου, ἡ δ’ ἐν
μεθορίοις Σαυνιτῶν καὶ Λευκανῶν. συμβάλλουσι δὲ ἄμφω κατὰ Βενεουεντὸν
καὶ τὴν Καμπανίαν ἐκ τοῦ Βρεντεσίου. τούντεῦθεν δ’ ἤδη μέχρι τῆς Ρώμης
Ἀππία καλεῖται διὰ Καυδίου καὶ Καλατίας καὶ Καπύης καὶ Κασιλίνου
μέχρι Σινοέσσης· ἡ δὲ πᾶσά ἐστιν ἐκ Ρώμης εἰς Βρεντέσιον μίλια τριακόσια
ἑξήκοντα. From Beneventum, as we thus see, there were two routes to
Brundisium: one, the continued Appian way by Venusia and Tarentum, · the
other, stretching eastwards across the mountains to the valley of the Aufidus,
by Canusium, to the coast of the Adriatic, and thence southward by Rubi,
Barium, and Egnatia to Brundisium. The latter was the route taken by
Maecenas on this occasion, and it is probably identical with the via Minuci
of Ep. 1. 18. 20, where see notes.

7. aquam. Bad water was the curse of travelling in Italy. It is four
times referred to in this poem: at Forum Appi; at the place with the un-
metrical name; at Canusium3 and at Egnatia. 9. comites: Heliodorus
and the slaves, or the rest of the passengers about to travel by the emal-boat.
iam nox: a sort of epic solemnity occasionally affected by Horace, cf. line
51 ; 2. 6. 100. 12. huc appelle: sc. lintrem, ‘put in here ' ; τὴν ἄκατον

a slave on the bank carrying some luggage to the boat. trecentos inseris
