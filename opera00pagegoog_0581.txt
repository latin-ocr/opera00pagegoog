and Spain were at a later time famous seats of Latin learning. In A. P. 345
Horace mentions as a sign of a good book that it was sent into the

7197501 tepidus: the word tepidus indicates a mean between jhot ' and
cold.' In Horace the notion suggested is usually that of comfortable Qarmth
(cf. od. 2. 6. 17; S. 2. 3. 10), and the phrase sol tepidus clearly describes
some time when it is neither too hot nor too cold but just comfortable to sit
and 1131011. Orelli argued for the time towards evening ”Vh-Q the sun has already
lost something of its-Qat (cf. Mart. 4. 8. 7 hora libellorum decima est, Eupheme,

benevoli lectores, after scattering to their houses for dinner, would gather again
to listen to his book reciting the poems it contained. But Μαι-1101 isjntention-
ally disparaging his own epigrams, when he represents them as only fit for the
after-dinner amusement of revellers, and there is no reason to suppose that
evening was the time usually chosen for public recitations. Kriiger therefore
explains of the loiterers round the shop of the Sosii, who would be more numerous
in the evening than at any other time (cf. Horace’s description of his own
practice S. 1. 6. 113), but this explanation takes no note of aures: ‘listeners ' not
‘ readers.' Others suppose that Horace is still regarding 1113 50οΕ as a‘school—
master 3 and that sol tepidus refers to the cooler days after the summer holi-
days (cf. S. 1. 6. 75 11.), when the schools would be full again. In that case
he would be giving a gloomy prophecy that few but schoolboys would read
his poems. This is barely in keeping with the tone of the following part of
