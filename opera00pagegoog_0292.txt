ODE XIV

‘ AZaS, Postumus, life is fast slippinq away .· from death neither piety nor ’

prayers nor costly hecatombs ean win a respice ; even the stronqest and most
dariny of the sons of earth the river of death imprisons, yes, the river we must
all cross, rich and poor alihe .· thither, for all our care and cautiori, we must
all wend our way, quiiiiny all that we hold most dear, leaving] to a rechless heir
the wealth os which we called ourselves the owners.'

1. Postume, Postume. Horace is very fond of this repetition of a
word: its use is to give emphasis, reduplication being the earliest and most
natural method of expressing intensity of feeling. The peculiar emphasis must
be determined by the context in each case. Here the object is to intensify
the idea of sadness3 so too 3. 3. 18 Ilion, Ilion ,· 4. 4. 70 occidit, occidit.
Cf. also such expressions as ‘Vanity of vanities, saith · the preacher, all is
vanity,' and for the repetition of a proper name, Matt. xxiii. 37 ⁴ O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets' ; Luke x. 41 ‘Martha‚ Martha!
On the other hand cf. 2. 17. 10 ibimus, ibimus (strong resolution), 1. 13. 1

Telephi . . . Telephi (fondness), l. 35. 15 ad arma . . . ad arma, 4. 2. 49 io ,

Triumphe . . . io Triumphe, 4. 13. 1 audivere Di . . . Di audivere (exulta-
tion), 4. 13. 10 ie quia . . . te quia (derision). 2. labuntur. This word,
which is frequently used either of the motion of a stream (Ep. 1. 2. 43) or of
the heavenly bodies (labentia siyna Lucr. 1. 23 Virg. Gr. 1. 6), expresses
motion which, without being hurried, is unceasing (ohne Hast doch ohne
Rast), and is constantly applied to the silent flight of time. Cf. Ov. Fast.
6. 771 Tempora labuntur tacitisque senescimus annis, and see Dict. s. v.

3. rugis . . . senectae . . . morti: note the advance. 4. indomitae, μ ’

‘unconquerable'3 cf. l. 24. 7 n.; Hom. Il. 9. 158 Ἀίδης ἀδάμαστος.

5. non . . . ‘no, not if with three hecatombs of bulls each day that
passes you essay to appease tearless Pluto . . .' Most MSS. read tricenis,
but this from triyinia would have the first syllable long. 6. inlacrima-
bilem, ‘who never weeps‚’ i.e. can never be moved to pity3 cf. 1. 3. 22 n.
8. Geryone . A Spanish giant with three bodies, whose oxen were carried
off by Hercusses. Tityon: Τιτύον; cf. 3. 4. 77; 4. 6. 2. He was a son
of Earth, and insulted Latona. Geryon and Tityos are selected as symbols
of enormous strength subdued by death notwithstanding. , tristi com-
pescit unda, ‘confines with melaneholy stream'; cf. 2. 20. 8 nee Siyyia
cohibebor unda. With its slow and weary windings nine times interposed
the Styx formed the boundary of Tartarus ; cf. Virg. G. 4. 478 tardaque palus
inamabilis unda l alligat ei noviens δίψα interfusa coercet ; Aen. 6. 438.

9. scilicet, from scire licet: ‘surely,’ ‘ doubtless,' is frequently used, as
here, where an incontrovertible statement is repeated with fresh emphasis

and particularity3 ‘ with melancholy stream² yes, the stream that all must
gamma. . .’ Of. 1. 3 . . ’ . qulcumque . . . vescimur, ‘w oe'iie'r
seed on the bounty of earth,' a reproduction of Hom. Il. 6. 142 βροτῶν οἱ ἀρού-
ρης καρπὸν ἔδουσιν. 11. sive reges Ι sive ε N otes on Meti-es p. xviii.
ἓ 4. reges, ‘kings‚' 01· possibly ‘rich men' 3 cf. 1. 4. 14. 12. coloni
(from colo), ‘husbandmen.’ 13. carebimus, ‘we shall keep free from.’
14. fractis fluctibus, ‘ the breakers.' Note the sound of these two lines,
15. per autumnos . . . Austrum. Autumn is the most unhealthy part
of the year in Italy, owing partly to the prevalence of the Sirocco wind
