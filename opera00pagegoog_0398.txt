conditional sentences where the protasis is put vigorously as a statement,
instead of hypothetically with si. quid expediat seems used with an inf.
just as quid inpediat might regularly be, Horace being fond of bold uses of
the inf.; cf. within a few lines hac (sente-ntia) ire ; habet suadere ; occupare
moramur. Others explain quid expediat (quaeritis) . . . quaerit-is carere . . . ,
