inlabatur . . . ferient: note the irregular consecution, the indic. expressing
the certainty, the subj. the hypothesis ,· cf. Virg. Aen. 1. 374.

9. hac arte, ‘by such virtue,' i.e. by the virtue described in line 1 3 cf. 4.
15. 12 veteres artes, ‘ the virtues of antiquity.’ For Pollux, Hercules, and
Bacchus, see Dict. Ant. They are frequently selected as types of deified
mortale, cf. 4. 5. 363 Ep. 2. 1. 53 Tac. Ann. 4. 38. 10. enisus . . .
‘ striving upwards reached the starry heights.' Some MSS. give innisus
11. quos inter . . . The introduction of the living Augustus ‘quaffing
nectar with ruddy lips ' in this Roman Valhalla for departed heroes is start-
ling. To speak of the Emperor as a ‘god on earth,' as ⁴,destined to return to
heaven ' (1. 2. 41-52), is only the language of extravagant flattery and the
purest Latin writers (ay. Virg. G. 1. 24), but to speak of a person actually
living as actually ‘ drinking nectar in heaven ² is to offend not only our moral
but our intellectual judgment, an offence of which classical writers are rarely
guilty. Many MSS. give bibet which looks like a correction but perhaps im·
proves the passage. The use of the term Augustus seems to place the date
of the Ode about B.c. 27, when that title was eonferred on him ; see Merivale,
c. xxx„ Ovid, Fast. 1. 609. 12. purpureo ore, says Wickham, ‘implies
the halo of rosy light which surrounds the beatified Augustus '3 the more
prosaic rendering ‘ruddy,' ele. with wine, seems more natural, but should be
perhaps rejected for that reason in a passage of this character.

13. merentem, tle. as having travelled through Asia teaching men the use
of the vine, and introducing civilisation (of which the tamed tigers are a type).
16. Martis equis, ‘on the chariot of Mars‚' his father. Ovid, Fast. 2. 493,
describes the ascent of Romulus to heaven: hinc tonat, hinc missis abrumpitur
iynibus aether .· Ι fit fuya ,· ‘rex patriis astra petebat equis. 17. gratum

. . ‘when J uno had spoken welcome words . . .' Horace implies that
Quirinus was not admitted into heaven until J uno assented. 18. Ilion,
Ilion. The repetition is solemn and impressive: she dwells on the name of
the city whose fortunes had so long excited her passionate interest. See 2. 14.
1 n. 19. fatalis, ‘ doomed‚’ i.e. bringing with him death and destruction.
iudex refers to the famous ‘J udgment of Paris ' which brought on him the
wrath of J uno, cf. Virg. Aen. 1. 26 manet alta ‘mente repostum Ι iudicium
Paridis spretaeque inim-w formae. 20. mulier peregrina, τῖε. Helen.
It is to the rape of Helen that incestus refers, although it also hints at his
decision in favour of Venus rather than of J uno or Minerva (cf. castae line 23).

- 21. ex quo . . . Laomedon, ⁶ since the day when Laomedon having
fixed their reward failed the gods.’ Apollo and Neptune helped Laomedon to
build the walls of Troy, and he then refused them their wageS. ex quo
( :ex quo tempore) with damnatum3 the city was ⁴ condemned from the day-
when,' etc. 25. iam . . . hospes. ‘The Spartan wanton's shameless
guest Ι No longer flaunts in brave array.’—Martin. It is simpler to take
(adulterae as gen. after hospes than as dat. after splendet, though splendet
(adulterae might mean ‘ decks himself for‚' ie. to please‚ his mistress. Horace
also refers to the brilliant appearance of Paris 1. 15. 13-20‚ 4: 9. 13-16 ; cf.
Hom. 11. 3. 392 κάλλεΐ τε στίλβων καὶ εἵμασιν. 26. Paris is called famosus
hospes, ‘the infamous guest,' because his violation of the laws of hospitality
added double infamy to his crime. 28. refringat, ‘breaks (and drives)
back ἐ the word is used of first breaking and then driving backwards an
enemy's line. 29. nostrisque . . . ‘ and the strife prolonged by our
