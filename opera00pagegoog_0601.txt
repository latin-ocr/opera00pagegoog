claroque, ‘illustrious‚' whether by birth and position or by his exploitS.
3. Tibure vel Gabiis: the boy was of Latin birth, not one of the less
valuable slaves, imported from the East. 4. candidus, ‘fair of com-
plexion,’ not fuscus, like Hydaspes in S. 2. 8. 14; or perhaps ‘without
blemish.' It would be out of place to refer it here to his moral qualitieS.
talos ad imOS, a proverbial expression: cf. Cic. pro Rosc. C. 7. 20 mm‘ne
ab imis unyaibas usque ad verticem summum ea: fraude, fallaciis, mendaciis
constare totus videtur? 5. flet eritque: mere tautology 011 the part of
the fluent slave-dealer with an imitation of legal smplusage. nummorum
milibus οπο, about ³670, a very low price for a slave with any attractions
and accomplishments. The servi litterati of Calvisius Sabinus cost 100,000
sesterces each (Seneca, Ep. 27. 7). The value of slaves at Rome naturally
ranged within very wide limits (cf. Wallon, Histoire de l'Esclavage, 2. 159-
174) : Cato the Censor never gave more than 1500 drachmas (about ³254) for
any slave (Plut. Cat. 1), and in his censorship required that a slave under
twenty years of age, who had been purchased for 10,000 asses (about 5:30)
or more, should be assessed at ten times the price paid for him, 011 which
assessment he then laid a triple tax in order to discourage this form of ex-
travagance (Livy 39. 44). Martial on the other hand (1. 59. 1 ; 2. 63. 1)
speaks of young slaves as sold for 100‚000 sesterces (1:800). Perhaps from
εἴ850 to 3660 may be taken as an average price sor an ordinary slave : Davus in
S. 2. 7. 43 speaks of himself as bought for 500 drachmae, 120. about 220.

6. verna, a slave bred at home, and therefore fit for domestic duties, not
mere field-work. ministeriis, dat. with captus. ad nutus, ‘at the
beck ' ε cf. Cio. Or. 8. 24 ad eorum arbitrium et ‘nutum totos se finyunt. 7.
litterulis inbutus, ‘ with some slight knowledge of letters ': inbutus of
itself has a depreeiatory force: ef. 1. 2. 69 11. ; Cic. Tusc. 1. 7. 14 an tu dia-
lecticis ne inbutus quidem es? Suet. de Gramm. 4 ozon perfectum litteris, sed
inbutum. The diminutive litterulis adds to the disparaging tone. arti
cuilibet: an educated slave might be used as a reader (anaynostes), copyist
(librarius, scriba) or amanuensis (servus ab epistolis). Cf. Ter. Eun. 3. 2. 19
en eunuchum tibi, . . . sac periclum in litteris, fae in palaestra, irc musicis: quae
liberum scire aequomst adulescentem sollertem dabO. 9. indoctum, ‘ in
an untrained fashion': Roby 1096, S. G. 461. bibenti, when a man
would be less critical. The dealer does not lay too much stress upon his
slave’s accomplishments, for sear of leading the purchaser to think that there
must be serious faults to account for his being offered so cheap.

10. levant : lem'orem faciunt, minuunt Comm. Cruq. 11. extru-
dere, quite our ‘push off.' Many MSS. have excludere. 12. meo in
aere ε cf. Cic. in Verr. Act. 2. 4. 6. 11 hminem video . . . ozon modo in aere alieno
nullo, sed in sais nummis multis esse ac semper fuisse. pauper often
denotes not poverty but means slender yet sufficient, as contrasted with
incliyus or eyens; cf. Od. 1. 12. 43 n. 13. mangonum, ‘the slave-
dealers.' 'rhe word is probably identical with our -monyer (A.-S. manqere ⁴ a
dealer ')‚ Germ. -smenyer, from manqian ‘to traffic‚' and ultimately from many
‘a mixture.’ non temere: cf. 2. 1. 120 n. I would not do this for
everybody. 14. cessavit, ‘shirked his work '3 cf. cessator S. 2. 7. 100.
ut fit, ‘as usuaL' as boys will do; cf. Cic. Verr. Act. 2. 2. 23. 56 queri, ut fit,
incipiunt. 15. in scafis latuit: the wooden staircase in the corner of the
house (so always at Pompeii) furnished the most natural temporary biding-
place ; cf. Cic. pro Mil. 15. 40 cum se ille (Clodius) sumens in scalarum late—
