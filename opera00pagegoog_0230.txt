changed guise dost on earth take the form of a youth (i.e. Augustus), sub-

‘may it be long before thou dost return.' Notice the flattery of redeas:
Augustus being an incarnate deity does not merely go to heaven, but returns
to it as his home.

conferred on Augustus in B.c. 2, but had been long applied to him before in
common talk, cf. 3. 24. 27 n. princeps: 4. 14. 6 11. 51. Medos:

writers use the adj. as: ‘Persian' (6.9. in Thuc. τὰ Mn6ctcd=the Persian

the Roman poets speak of ‘Medes ’ and ‘ Persians' instead of ‘Parthians'z

victories of Salamis and Marathon. equitare, ‘ career,' as if in scorn;
cf. 4. 4. 44. The Parthian light horsemen amid their sandy deserts were the

ODE III

⁴ Ο ship that conveyest Viryil to Greece, duty deliver up the preeious life
entrusted to thy care. Boia indeed was the man who first trusted himself to
the sea, but Itis was only one of the many impious attempta which men, such
as Prometheus, Daedalus and Hercules, have made to transgress the Zimits
which God in His providence has appointed .· the constant renewal of these
attempts prevenis Jupiter from Zayiny aside his thunderbolts of corath?

For Virgil’s intimacy with Horace see Sellar's Virgil, pp. 120-126. Virgil
and Varius first introduced Horace to Maecenas, and he speaks of them with
singular affection, cf. S. 1. 5. 41 ; 1. 6. 54 optimus Vergilius, and Ode 1. 24.
We only lmow of one visit of Virgil to Athens, in B.0. 19, on the return from
which, he died at Brundisium Sept. 22. All the Odes of Books I.-III. are
much earlier, and therefore this Ode must refer to a previous voyage, such as
may well have been· undertaken by the poet of the Aeneid to visit the soenes
he has aided to immortalise. Some feel the difficulty so much that they
suppose the Virgil mentioned not to be the poet, but surely there was only
one Virgil who was to Horace ‘the half of life.' See too Epod. 10 Intr.
