91. Euandri manibus tritum, either (1) ‘worn by the hands of
Evander‚’ the mythical Italian king, i.e. of venerable antiquity; like the
brazen foot-bath of Sisyphus 2. 3. 213 or (2) ‘shaped by the hands of

Evander‚' a caelator (chaser of silver) and statuary (plastes statuarum), said .

to have been brought by M. Antony from Athens to Alexandria, thence to
Rome by Octavian after the battle of Actium. This is the explanation of
Porph.‚ who says he derived it from those qui de personis Horatianis scrip-
serunt, and Avianius Evander a statuary is mentioned Cic. ad Fam. 7. 23 ;
13. 2 and Pliny 36. 5. 32. But Horace is clearly satirising the fashionable
craze for antiques at Rome, cf. Mart. 8. 6. 9 hi duo Zonyaevo censentur Nestore
fandi Ι pollice de Pylio trita columba nitet, where trita exactly answers to
tritum here, while to use tritum of a caelator or sculptor is most unnatural.
92. positum ante=antepositum‚ ‘served up.' mea in parte, ‘in the
part of the dish next to me! 95. fide, the old dat. and genit.‚ frequent in
Plautus, cf. Od. 3. 7. 4. sponsumve negarit, ‘ disowned his bond ’ : refer-
ring to a man becoming security for his friend, and then denying his liability.

96. quis=quibus, cf. 1. 1. 75: the form is used by Horace only in his
earliest writings, the Satires and Epodes. The Stoics held that offences were
equal. fere, to be j0ined with paria: see on 2. 3. 32. placuit, δέδοκ-
ται, ‘ they have laid it down.' laborant, ἀποροῦσιν, they are at a loss when
they come to deal with practical life, ad verum. 97. sensus, sing. ‘in-
stinct,’ as Cic. de Fin. 4. 19. 55, arguing against the same paradox, says,
sensus enim cuiusque et natura rerum atque ipsa veritas clamabat quodam
modo, non posse adduci, ut inter eas res quas Zeno exaequaret nihil interesset.
moresque, ‘the rules of life‚' cf. Od. 4. 4. 35 n. 98. utilitas . . . aequi.
That the distinctions of right and wrong are founded in utility has been held
without the prope by a numerous school of modern philosopher-s from Hobbes
to Mill. Cp. Plato, Rep. v. 457 Β. It is clearly an Epicurean view. 101.
Nails, fists‚ cudgels‚ and so on step by step (porro) till they fought with arms.
In our civilised days we have got on to grape-shot and torpedoes. 102.
arma includes both tela and armour. usus, ‘experiencess or ‘necessity'
103. donec verba: language was the first step in civilisation; next law.
verba, ῥήματα, articulate words, with which men gave meaning and shape to

voces, the inarticulate sounds of the savage voice. 104. nomina, ὀνόματα,
names for external things. Cf. A. P. 234.

111. iura inventa metu. Laws, embodying distinctions of right and
wrong, were invented: they were not made by nature ready to man's hand.
Nature of herself drew no clear and evident line between right and wrong.
They slide into each other by gradations‚ and there are gradations of crime,
and ought to be gradations of punishment. The Stoics, on the other hand,
said that τὸ δίκαιον existed φύσει )( Oe‘oeczinventa. 113. iusto . . . ini-
quum, neuter, ‘Nature cannot discriminate between what is just and un-
just 111 the same way as she distinguishes between good things and their
opposites ' (as, for instance, she distinguishes between health and sickness,
pain and pleasure). 115. nec vincet ratio hoc, ‘nor shall philosophy
prove this, that‚' ete. vincere hoc, to carry this point, like νικᾶν ’γνώμηνε
and vincere causam. This is an exceptional use of ut with subj. for the usual
acc. and inf. (for which cf. 2. 3. 225) : ut is due to the interposition of hoc, of
which ut peccet is epexegetic. 116. qui teneros caules. By the laws of
Draco idle persons and those who stole vegetables‚ τοὺς λάχανα κλέψαντας,
were punished equally with sacrilegious thjeves (ἱερόσυλοι) and homicides
