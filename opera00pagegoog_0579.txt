38. tritae: cf. Pers. 1. 54 scis comitem horridulum trita donare lacerna ,-
Mart. 12. 72. 4 tritae praemia certa togae. 39. nobilium: is this ironical
or not? If it is, we must take it thus: ‘1 never listen to these illustrious
writers, and retaliate upon them by reciting my own poems‚ and therefore Ι
have no need to stoop to court the critice? But it seems better, as there is
no indication of irony in the context, and nothing pointing to poetasters rather
than to critics as in his thoughts„ to take it as seriously meant, and as referring
to Pollio, virgil, Varius and others of the circle round Maecenas: ultor 18
111811 an expression of kindly humour, and not of bitterness, as in J uv. 1. 1,
⁴ I who listen only to writers of name and fame, and retaliate upon them, do
not deign to court ’ etc. Horace did recite his poenis to his friendS, cf. S. 1.
4. 73. 40. grammaticaszyrammaticomm‚ ‘criticS‚' ‘professors of litera-
ture‚’ cf. A. P. 78. tribuet the metaphor is that of a candidate courting
the suffrages of the Roman tribes at an election. The word has also a touch
of contempt in it, like our own ‘tribe ’ and φῦλον. Τ118 pulpitum was properly
the platform of the stage (2. 1. 174 ; A. P. 215, 274), but here it is the <lais
on which the teacher’s chair (cathedra S. 1. 10. 91) 18 placed.

41. hino illae lacrimae: in the Andria of Terence old Simo 18118 how
1118 8011 Pamphilus shed 18318 31 1118 funeral of a neighbour named Chrysis.
At first the father took it to be a sign of his son’s affectionate character, that
he was so much touched by the death of a mere acquaintance. But it turned
out that Chrysis had left a charming sister: and when the old man saw her
(11118 125) 118 cried 0111 atat, hoc illud est, hinc illae lacrimae, haec illast miseri-
cordia. The phrase became proverbial. and was used as here even when there
was no question of actual tears. Of. Cic. pro Cael. 25. 61.

41-49. M y critice ridicule my modesty as affected, but I will not cross swords
with them, and 80 I decline a combat, which could only lead to ill feeling. 41.
spissis, ‘thronged’: cf. A. P. 205 sffssssa sedilia. theatris: not public
theatreS, but private halls lent by rich pati-ons to poets for recitations, cf.

126 ; 2. 2. 99), where the speaker’s words are directly quoted, but Virg. often
has ait. Iovis=Au9u3ti. Horace never directly applies this name to the
Emperor, as Ovid does without scruple: and in the mouth of his critics it
perhaps carries something of 3 811881. 44. manare with a quasi-transitive
force, like ῥεῖν. 45. tibi, ‘in your own eyes.² naribus uti, ‘to sneer
at them open1y‚’ cf. S. 1. 6. 5 11. 46. acuto . . . ungui: cf. 011. 1. 6.
18. Horace implies that the malice of his opponents is such that they will
stoop to scratching or any kind of attack. 47. 1818 loona, ⁶ the place you
have chosen.' diludia dicuntur tempora, quae yladiacoribus conceduntur,

EPISTLE XX

An epilogue to the First Book. The book is humorously addressed as though
it were a young slave, eager to escape from the safe retirement of his master’s
house, to see the great city, and to find lovers there, while he is ignorant of
the dangers that await him, and the risk of desertion and neglect, when return
