239. edicto ε cf. Pliny, H. N. 7. 37. 125 idem hie imperator edixit, ne quis
ipsum alius quam Apelles pingeret, quam Pyrgoteles sculperet, quam Lysippus
ex aere duceret. But as there were representations of the king by other
artists we can only 1mderstand this to mean either that Alexander gave com-
missions himself to no othere, or that he never sat to any one else. Apellen:
cf. 1. 2. 12 n. 240. Lysippo: for the case cf. 1. 16. 20 n. The advance in
statuary made by Lysippus is thus described by Pliny, H. N. 34. 8. 19 plurimum
traditur contulisse capillum exprimendo, capita minora faciendo quarn antiqui,
corpora yraciliora siccioraque, per quae proceritas siynorum maior m‘deretur.
He limited himself to bronze casting, and never worked in marble. Propert.

‘modeL' 242. subtile, ‘exact’: Pliny (H. N. 35. 10. 85) gives a very
different account of Alexander's critical faculty: Alexandro Maqno frequenter
in officinam ventitanti . . . imperite multa disserenti (Apelles) silentium
comiter suadebat, rideri eum dicens a pueris, qui colores tererent. videndis
artibus : probably the dative, ‘for viewing works of art.' videre is used with
an extended forcezvisu aestimare or videndo diiudicare. 244. Boeo-
tum, geu. plur., Roby 365, S. G. 115. The dull, heavy air of Boeotia (due
to the, vapour arising from the valleys and lakes) is often contrasted with
that enjoyed by the Athenians, who were ἀεὶ διὰ λαμπροτάτου βαίνοντες
ἁβρῶς αἰθέρος (Eur. Med. 829); cf. Cic. Fat. 4. 7 Athenis tenue caelum, ea:
quo acutiores etiarn putantur Attici: erassum Thebis, itaque pinques Thebani:
Juv. 10. 50. Pindar, Ol. 6. 152, speaks J‘estingly of the proverbial Βοιωτία ὔς.

245. dedecorant: the subjects Vergilius Variusque are transferred,
as often, to the relative clause. 246. munera, i.e. the gifts which the
poets had received from Augustus, At his death 111 19 B.c.—some years
before the date of this Epistle—-Virgil's fortune is said to have amounted to
10‚000‚000 sesterces, mostly if not entirely due to the bounty of patrous, For
Varius cf. od. 1. 6. 1 11. multa dantis cum laude, i.e. all men warmly
praise such judicious liberality, instead of laughing at it, as in the case of
Alexander and Choerilus. 248. expressi, ‘reproduced': the metaphor
is taken from plastic figures in clay or wax, and then becomes more general,
and is used of imitation generally: cf. Cic. de Orat. 3. 12. 47 vitia imitatione
ea: aliquo expressa ,· pro Arch. 6. 14 rnilltas nobis imaqines fortissimorum
vivorum expressas scriptores Graeci et Latini reliquerunt.

250. sermones here includes both Satires and Epistles. 'Phe style of the
EpistleS, though somewhat more careful than that of the Satires», is essentially
the sermo quotidianus. Conington renders “ Nor is it choice (ah, would that
choice were all 1) Ι Makes my dull Muse in prose-like numbers crawl.'' So in
S. 2. 6. 17 Horace speaks of his musa pedestris, 251. res componere
gestas, i. e. to write a historical epic poem. 252. arces montibus
inpositas, stormcd by the Roman armies ε cf. Od. 4. 14. 11 arces Alpibus in-
positas. 253. tuis auspiciis: Augustus from 23 Rc. onwards held a
perpetual proconsulare imperium over the whole empne, and even in the
senatorial provinces he had an imperium maius, which made their governors
for-mally subordinate to him. Hence the iustus triumphus could no longer be
enjoyed by successful generals, who were only serving under his auspices, not

triumph, but afterwards (apparently after 15 B.c.) this honour was reserved to
