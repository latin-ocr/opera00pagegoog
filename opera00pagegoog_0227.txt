ODE II

This Ode is addressed to Augustus as the almost divine protector and
guardian of the Roman state. It commences with an account of the portents
which indicated 1116 wrath of 1116 gods at the murder of Caesar (on the Ides
of March, Β.0. 44) 1-20, alludes to 1116 civil war which followed 21-24, asks
to what god the duty of expiating the guilt of Rome shall be assigned, and
finally gives the preference to Mercury‚ who (line 41) is supposed to take upon
him 1116 form of Augustus. The Ode concludes with a prayer 11161 Augustus
may long live to guide and guard the state. -

The mention of mynos triumphos in line 49 1163 suggested 29 13.o. as the
date. In that year Augustus returned to Rome as master of the Roman
world, and on the 7111 and following days of Sextilis (thereafter called
Augustus) celebrated his triple triumph over the Dalmatians, over Cleopatra
at Actium, and over the Alexandrians. If, however, so late a date be assigned,
Β. 0. 28, when he actually received the title of princeps (cf. line 50), suits better.
Plfiss argues for Ec. 36 immediately after the defeat of Sex. Pompeius,
when the portents which followed the death of Caesar were past but not
forgotten, and when Octavian first began to be regarded as the possible
saviour of the state, cf. line 25. For the whole Ode cf. the brilliant passage
of Virgil, G. 1. 465 10 1116 end, and for the portents Shak. J ul. Caes. I. 111.

of Jupiter Capitolinus, and the two summits would naturally be termed
