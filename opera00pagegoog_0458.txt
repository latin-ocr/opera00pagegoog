430 HORAOE Boon 11

found that his Satires had made him unpopular, as we have 00011 before (1.
4). .He had probably been advised to abandon them, and to take to some
other branchos poetry; and this poem may be regarded as an answer to
those who advised 'him so. Keeping to the dramatic form, which he has
cultivated all through the second book, he represented himself as consulting
the famous J'urist C. Trebatius Testa on the point. This wiseacre at first
advises him to give up writing, line 5; then to compose an epic poem in
honour of Augustus, 11 ; or at any rate a eulogium on his virtues, 16 3 Satire'
makes 0110111100, 23. To this Horace replies that he cannot rest from writing,
7 ; 11101 epic poetry is beyond him, 13 ; that Caesar is a dangerous theme for
a man to handle, 20, and that it is his bent to be a satirist, 25-56. Lucilius
did not lose the friendship of his great patrous Scipio and Laelius by casti-
gating the vices of the day3 and Horace follows in his steps, not only as
a satirist, but as the welcome friend of great men, 62-79. To Trebatius's
warning to beware of the penalties to which lampoons are subJ'ect he replies
with a joke, 80-86. As regards the date, it is clear from the beginning that
Horace had 1101 yet done much in lyric poetry3 so the date could not have
been much after 30. On the other hand the direct and marked praises of
Octavian (invicti line 11) shows that the poem was written after his power
had received its final confirmation, i.e. after Actium.

. 1. satura: not used in Book I; in Book II here and 2. 6. 17. - 2.
legem: like operis lex A. P. 1353 cf. line 63 operis morem. sine
nervis: cf. delumbe PerS. 1. 104, ‘nerveless stuff.' 4. deduci, ‘turned
out' 3 but the metaphor is from spinning, cf. Ep. 2. 1. 225 11. Trebati:
O. Trebatius Testa was a famous jurisconsult, formerly a friend of Cicero's.
Seventeen of the letters of the 7th book ad Fam. are addressed to him, and
the 5th of that book is a letter introducing him to Caesar, iu Gaul. In this
letter (about B. Ο. 55) Cicero speaks highly of his character and also says that
he was the greatest lawyer of the day (familiam ducit iri iare civili) while
freely chaffing him as a good-natured old fellow. 5. praescribe: very
generally used of advice given by any person in authority. quiescas, i. e.
praescribo at quiescas: ‘be still.' ne faciam, 1.0. (praescribis) ‘ne faciam ,-
cf. Cic. ad Att. 16. 3. 6 quam ei praescriptum esset, oie quid sine Sestii nostri
,sententia aqerei.

6. peream male = κάκιστ’, ἀπολοίμην. si . . . erat, ‘if it would
not have been best.’ The imperfect implies that Horace sees difficulties in the
way of following the advice of Trebatius, as it denotes that he has not hitherto
acted as he suggests· For this imperfect o'f neglected duty cf. Ov. Her. 1. 112
in patrias artes erudiendas erat ,- and perhaps Od. 1. 37. 4 tempus erat. So
poteras line 16. ’7. verum . . . dormire: of course the excuse is pure
invention (cf. 2. 3. 3 somni benignas). He sleeps badly, he says, and finds
making verses a sedative. Trebatius takes him seriously and prescribes hard
exercise. ter with transnanto: the objection that if a man swam thrice
across a river he would find himself on the far side from his clothes did not
occur to Trebatius. For ter, which was a favourite number with physicians
and witches, cf. Od. 1. 28. 36; 3. 22. 3; Ep. 1. 1. 373 Juv. 6. 523. So in
all modern fairy tales and legends, the third time is the charm. The forms
transnanto, habentO, are used by Trebatius as having a legal sound‚ such
forms being always used in 01010100. transnanto: Trebatius was himself
very fond >of swimming, as we learn from Cicero ad Fam. 7. 10. 2, where he
thus writes to Trebatius J‘oking h'im on his unwillingness to face the British
campaign: qui neque ivi >Oceano natare volueris studiosissimus homo natandi.
