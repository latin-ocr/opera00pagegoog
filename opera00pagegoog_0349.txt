its old corner. M. Calpurnius Bibulus was consul with C. Julius Caesar in
the famous year B.c. 59, but the name is obviously selected in jol.·e.

9. nos cantabimus . . . ‘we will sing in turn, (Ι) of Neptune . . .,
you shall in reply tell of Latona . . .’ Horace begins the sentence as if he
were going to say ‘ we will sing in turn of Neptune . . . and Latona' (i. e. Ι
of Neptune, you of Latona), but in the second half of the sentence in order to
make it more clear who is to undertake the reply (recines) and sing of Latona,
he inserts the words tu recines, which make the sense clear but somewhat
interfere with the strict grammar. Some take nos invicem ‘ I in my turn,’
but though nos is often=‘I,’ it cannot be so here where it naturally
must mean ‘ I and you ' and where the use of it: ‘I ’ must produce confusion.

ODE XXIX

‘A warm welcome awaits you, Maecenas, at my house .· come then at once.
Cease merely to ²qaze lonqinyly on the country, and leave Rome for a while and
all its maynificence and cares. Rich men sometimes find the change lo a
humble household a relies. The d09·days moreover are cominy on, and yet you
linyer in town and worry your-sels about political continyencies. What is the
qood Ζ Providence has scaled the future and mocks our efforts to read it.
Oalmly to deal with the present is wisdom,· sor life is like a river and moves
alonq uncontrolled by us sometimes peacefully sometimes a rayiny torrent. He
lives best who enjoys to-day; to-morrow Jupiter may send trouble but he cannot
undo the past. Fortune is ever fickle : I accept her favour and put up with
her frowns. In stormy weather I am not like a merchant fearful lest his rich
earyo be lost: it is enough for me if I weather the tempest myself’

This use of iam dudum with a present is very frequent. 6. udum ε cf. 1.

the hillside between Tibur and Praeneste, cf. Livy 26. 9. 9; 32. 9. 2.
