ultimae, ⁴ farthest back‚' and so ‘ earliest,' ‘ first.' stetere would in prose
be exstitere but is much more emphatic, not only meaning ‘ have turned out‚'
‘ have proved‚’ but also suggesting the ideas of unconquerable strength and
stability. The simple sto is always very emphatic and powerful: its
brevity gives it force, cf. Stat Fortuna Domus. altis . . . perirent
funditus: Hom. Il. 13. 772 ὤλετο πᾶσα, κατ’ ἄκρης ΙἼλιος αἰπεινή.

21. aratrum. The walls of a new city were marked out with the
plough, and so the utter destruction of a city is symbolised by the plough
being driven over its walls. insolens, ‘ arrogant. The word indicates

aHis Sabine farm was presented to Horace by Maecenas Β.0. 34. Ηο fre-
quently refers to it with great affection, ay. 2. 18. 14 unicis Sabinis ,· 3. 1. 47.

1. Lucretilem: a mountain (now Monte Gennaro) overhanging Horace’s
villa. Pan is always described as ὀρειβάτης (and here Horace evidently
identifies the Latin Faunus with the Greek Pan, cf. line 10, where he plays on
the Pan-pipe), and his native haunts were the mountains of Arcadia, especi-
ally Lycaeus. 2. mutat, ‘accepts in exchange ' : so too 2. 12. 23 permu-

unsavoury lord.’ The expression is very peculiar even in Latin, and worse in
English. For umores, mariti, applied to animals‚ cf. Virg. Ecl. 7. 7 vir yreqis
ipse caper ,· Theoc. 8. 49 ὦ τράγε τᾶν λευκᾶν αἶ’γᾶν ἄνερ.

9. Martiales. A standard epithet of wolves. It was a she-wolf that
suckled the famous offspring of Mars. haediliae, ‘ young kids '3 from
haedus, like porcina from porcus. The reading is found in Porphyrion and
confirms Bentley's conjecture haeduleae. The old Haediliae (gen.) was ex-
