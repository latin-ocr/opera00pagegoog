σὺ μέν, ἐκείνη ὂέ; in English we must insert a word3 ‘meantime‚ while you
take out . . . (and) she whets her dreadful fangs, the judge of the combat is
said . . .’ Note the skill in word-painting with which Horace almost brings
before our eyes this group of three figures, the combatants on either side in
the foreground, Nearchus behind in the centre. 11. nudo: pictorial.
12. palmam, τῖε. the prize of victory, cf. 1. 1. 5 n. 15. qualis, ‘ such as,’
i.e. ‘beautiful as! cf. Il. 2. 673 Νιρεύς, ὃς κάλλιστος ἀνὴρ ὑπὸ Ἴλιον ἦλθε Ι

ODE XXI

Addressed to an amphora on the occasion of the poet's entertaining
Corvinus. M. Valerius Messala Corvinus fought with Brutus and Cassius at
Philippi, Rc. 42, and subsequently j0ined Antony, but about B.c. 36 went
over to Augustus, and as consul 13.c. 31 commanded the centre of the fleet at
Actium. He was distinguished as an orator and author and was, like Maecenas
and Polh‘o, a great patron of literature. Cf. S. 1. 10. 29 ; Α. Ρ. 371.

‘ C'ome dom, thou flayon, that art os the same aye with myself,· to·day
Corvinus bids us produce our ‘mellower vintayes. Philosopher thoussh ke is, he
ἰυἰίἰ not despice thee .· even ancient Cato's sternness warmed with wine. Thou
dost arouse the wits and bring] to liyht hidden wisdo‘m, thou dost yive hope to the
anxious and strength to the weak .· with thy aid the feast shall last till dawn.

1. ο nata . . . For the method os marking the age of wine see 3. 8. 10-
12 notes. Manlio: L. Manlius Torquatus, consul Β.0. 65 ; cf. Epod. 13. 6.
2. seu . . . sive . . . seu . . . seu„ Before he produces the amphora, Horace
muses half philosophically, half humorously‚ over the undefined potency for
good or evil that lurks within it. 4. pia testa. For pius see 3. 11.
30 n. Observe carefully the position of the two words between facilem and
somnum, and the subtle humour of the epithet at once appears: then and
then only does the win -’ar fulfil the natural duty or law of its being (this
being the exact meaning 0 “as), when it brings easy and peaceful slumber.

5. quocumque . . . ‘on whatever account thou guardest the choice
Massic? These words sum up the various possibilities of lines 2-4, prepara-
tory to the introduction of the main verb. quocumque nomine cannot
refer to the name of the consul stamped on the jar, as that has been mentioned,
nor to the name of the wine, as it is specially called ‘ Massic ' z it must there-
fore =‘ on whatever account‚' ‘for whatever purpose! As in a ledger the
name of the person whose ‘account ’ follows is placed at the head of each
page, nomen is frequently ‘ an account ’ 3 then it is used more generally of the
‘ account ’ 111 which anything is held, the ⁶ purpose ' it is considered to serve,

9. quamquam . . . ‘ steeped though he be in Socratic lore? madet
is used intentionally‚ madere and madidus being constantly used of drunken-

- ness. Socratici sermones specially refer to the dialogues of Plato, but also

generally to ‘philosophie arguments’ of the sort to which Socrates gave the
first impetus, cf. 1. 29. 14 n. 10. horridus, ‘like a boor’ or ‘churl'z
