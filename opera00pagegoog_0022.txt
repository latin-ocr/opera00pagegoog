xvi HORAOE

but he has succeeded in saying some common things better perhaps
than they will ever be said'again. Those who only respect what
they do not understand will not esteem him highly, but men of
sense will still continue to value his happy and epigrammatic
phrases which embody so much in so little, and are

Jewels five words long
That on the stretched forefinger of all time
Sparkle for ever.

It only remains to add that the Odes quickly suffered the fate
which their author most dreaded,1 and had become a regular
school-book in the century after his death? and have continued so
to the present day. Nor is this to be wondered at, for, though it
needs a scholar to fully understand the Odes and bring out the
meaning of each suggestive phrase while also tracing the often
very subtle 3 sequence of thought which links stanza to stanza,
still a large portion of the language is simplicity itself and it is
difficult to imagine what better model of Latin could be put before
a boy.

None of our extant MSS. are older than the 9th century, though
Oruquius in his edition (Aa). 1578> gives the readings of some MSS.4
now lost which may have been earlier. The Scholia, or collection
of comments, which bear the names of Acron and Porphyrion, often
carry us back to evidence which is much earlier and possibly goes
back to the 2nd or 3rd century.5 On the whole the text is fairly
satisfactory, and though some few passages are certainly corrupt or
interpolated‚⁶ yet there is 110 ground for suspecting that wholesale
alteration of the Odes which some critics 7 assume whenever the
meaning of a stanza or the connexion of thought between two
parts of an Ode is not immediately obvious to themselves

far from easy.
