328 HORACE BOOK 1v

6. notas, ⁶ accustomed‚’ aluere, ‘swollen.' Vei. Bland. reads cum
super notas saliere ⁴ when the rain-waters have leapt over‚’ which is not
so ‘absurd ’ as Orelli asserts. 7. fervet . . . ‘so Pindar boils and rushes
measureless with deep utterance.' inmensus and ruit go together; cf.
the Gk. idiom πολὺς ῥεῖ and S. 1. 4. 11 cum flueret lutulentus. inmensus is
used in reference (1) to Pindar’s copiousness of diction, (2) to the uncon-
strained liberty of his metres and movement, in both of which respects he
resembles a swollen torrent. inmensus Ι que: p. xix. ἓ 2.

9. laurea . . .: the construction is, donandus, (1) seu . . . devolvit, (2)
seu . . . canit, (3) sive . . . dicit . . . et donat, (4) iuvenemve . . . plostrum
Pindar is worthy of Apollo’s bay in any of the four kinds of lyric poetry
mentioned. 10. per audaces dithyrambos: per denotes the channel
through which the words flow, and keeps up the metaphor of stanza 2, cf.
also devolvit and fertur. For δῖθύραμβος 366 Liddell and Scott: as being
sung at the altar of Dionysus it was often very elevated and indeed bombastic
in style, and allowed the introduction of unusual or extraordinary words (nova
verba). 11. numerisque . . . ‘and sweeps along in numbers freed from
law.' As we do not possess any dithyrambic Odes of Pindar we cannot say
how far this criticism is just: his Epinician Odes exhibit a most careful
system of strophe, antistrophe, and epode, though of course as compared with
any metres used by Horace they might seem ‘lawless,’ much as Byron can
speak of Scott’s ‘immeasurable measures.²

13. seu deos . . . ι the reference is to Paeans, Παιᾶνες, hymns in honour
of gods and heroes, such as Theseus who slew the Oentaurs, and Bellerophon
who slew the Chimaera. 14. cecidere . . . cecidit: for this method
of Joining clauses see 1. 2. 4 n. N otice also below concines line 33, and oon-
eines line 41. 16. flamma Chimaerae, i.e. ‘ the fire-breathing Chimaera ’
(1. 27. 23 and note) 3 cf. Juv. 4. 107 Montani quoque venter adest, and such
Gk. phrases as Πολυνείκους βία, ‘ the mighty Polynices.' 17. sive quos . . . :
the reference is to the ἐπινίκια 01· triumpha] Odes, the only portion of Pindar’s
writings still extant, see Class. Dict. Elea palma, i.e. an Olympio
victory, Olympia being in Elis. palma: see 1. 1. 5 n. 18. caelestes,
‘godlike‚' ‘feeling themselves gods,' ἰσοθέους, cf. 1. 1. 6. The victor was con-
ducted home in a triumphal procession‚ during which the ἐπινίκιον was sung.
pugilemve equumve : for a list of the contests see Dict. of Ant. S.V.
Olympia. Pindar twice mentions Φερένικος, a horse of Hiero’s‚ but of course
‘ tells of a horse ’ means rather ‘ tells of its owner? 19. et donat further
explain dicit: ‘and (so) presente with a gift preferable to a hundred statues?

The statues of victors were set up in the sacred grove Altis at Olympia, and·
also in their native towns.

21. flebili . . . ‘or bewails the youth snatched from his weeping bride?
i.e. in a θρῆνος or dirge. Notice flebilis, ‘weeping,' as A. P. 123: on the
other hand, 1. 24. 9 flebilis oceidit, ‘he died much wept for ’ ; see 1. 3. 22 n.
22, 23. moresque, nigroque. Notice the two hypermetric verses:
Horace clearly aims at giving variety to the monotony of the Sapphic rhythm.
23. aureos, ‘golden,’ ie. ‘noble’3 cf. 1. 5. 9 11. ; 2. 10. 5; 4. 3. 17 testu-
dinis aureae. educit in astra . . . ‘exalts to the stars and grudges
the gloomy grave (its prey).’ Odes 8 and 9 dwell at length on the immor-
tality which the poet alone can bestow. The accusatives, vires, animum,
meree, are governed not only by educit, but by invidet: invideo takes aco.
of the thing begrudged, and dat. of the person to whom, e.g. Ιιοο tibi invideo.
