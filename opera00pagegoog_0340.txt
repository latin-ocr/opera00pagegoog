the word also recalls the ‘ ragged,’ ‘ unkempt ' appearance ostentatiously affected
by many philosophers then as now (Mayor, Juv. 14. 12 n.). 11. prisci,
‘ancient,' not so much because of his actual antiquity (he died 13.c. 149) as
because of his life-long battle on behalf of ancient manners, ancient customs,
and the ancient Roman ‘ manliness ' (see virtus, line 12). poiseus nearly always
has the double meaning ‘ ancient and venerable ' ε the person or thing to which
it is applied must belong to the ‘ ¹qood old times‚' cf. 4. 2. 40 ; Epod. 2. 2.

which makes the unwilling speak : cf. Ep. 1. 18. 38 ; A. P. 435 torquere mero.
iuyeuium durum is the opposite of inyeuium facile et copiosum (Quint. 10. l.
128). 15. curas et . . . Wickham rightly notes that Lyaeus (Λύαιος,
λύω, solvo) is ‘the god who gives freedom‚' and that so the whole sentence:
arcana consilia retegendo curas solvis, because ‘as cares seem heavy when
brooded over so they seem subJects for mirth when discussed over wine.’
18. viresque et addis . . . : que joins the two clauses, et the two nouns
vires and cornua. For horns as a symbol of strength cf. 2. 19. 29 n. 19.
neque iratos . . . ‘trembling neither at the angry diadems of kings.’
Note the hypallage, cf. 3. 1. 42 n. For apex=tiara or diadema see 1. 34.
14 n. 21. te . . . ‘thee Liber and, if she lend a propitious presence,
Venus, and the Graces loath to undo their hond, and living lanterns shall lead
on until . . .' 22. solvere: epexegetic inf. after seques; 1. 3. 25 n.
The Graces are represented as sisters who never separate. For vivae cf.

. . . tu Lucina dolentibus Ι Iuno dicta puerperia. For her as goddess of
groves, cf. 1. 21. 5. Like the Gk. ’Ἄρτεμις 3110 was also sometimes regarded
as the goddess of childbirth, and identified with quo Luciua3 cf. Ellis
on Catull. 1. c. 4. diva triformis. In heaven Luna, on earth Diana,
in hell Hecate. Her image had three faces (Ov. Fast. 1. 141) and was placed

6. quam . . . donem, ⁶ so that I may present it,' in connexion with tua esto.
per exactos ann08‚ ‘ at each year’s end ’ ; cf. 3. 18. 5 n. 7. obliquum
meditantis ictum, ‘practising its sidelong blow ' : the boar is a young one
J'ust trying its powers. ηιαίτὶιονεμελετάω. Boars strike with their tusks
