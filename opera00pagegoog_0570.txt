by introducing 1ο him unworthy acquaintances. It is in the concluding lines
96-103 that Horace gives his genuine advice, enforcing it by his own example

may take amicum as directly governed by profes-susi, like ayere amicum, mentiri
iuvenem. 4. discolor: prostitutes were required to wear a dark tom,
while matrons wore the white stola, and some find a reference to that practice
here. But probably discolor, as in Pers. 5. 32 mille hominum species et
rerum discolor usus, is merely: ⁴ different ’ : cf. vitae color 1. 17. 23 ; S. 2. 1. 60.

with 3 certain irony3 cf. 2. 1. 261. tonsa cute, ‘with hair clipped to

Roundheads and Cavaliers. 8. dum vult: of. 1. 19. 16. dici mera:
the old reading was mera dici ε but 1116 fourth feet composed of 3 single word,
and that a spondee, is very inelegant. 9. medium (zue'oov τι) vitiorum:

chief actor, and to imitate him in word and gesture, with perhaps something
of caricature. Suetonius (Galig. 57) tells a curious story: cum in Laureolo
mimo in quo actor proripiens se ruina sanquinem vomit, plures secundarum
certatim experimentum artis darent, cruore scaena abundavit. 15. rixatur:
the vet. Bland. has rixatus=‘ wrangling,’ for which rixans would be required.
. The asyndeton between rimatur and propuynat is objected to by many editors.
Muretus removed it by reading rimator, but this is not found before Quintilian

of the proverb.) Porphyrion shows better judgment: de villo ut quidam
