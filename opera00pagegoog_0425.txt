quote Quintilian's 3101113, esse aliquid, quod tollere possis. Bothe puts a full
stop at velles and makes yart-ulus and piger go with &rapinas zsthe position
of ecce is against 11113. Probably 13 should be struck out, and 12 placed after
8 or 9, if any alteration is made. 13. This has all the signs and tokens of
a spurious verse: the epanalepsis of scribendi: the solecistic construction of
nil moror: the ease with which the line may be omitted without damaging
the sense, and the obviousness of a hypothesis to account for its invention,
are points all of which are in favour of its excision. It seems likely that it
was inserted owing to the scribe not seeing that scribemli by itself is right 3
the lazy bard will not write himself, but merely dictate. The usual construc-
tion of nil 'moror is an acc. or an infinitive t here we have ut, and not only so,
but the verb, scribat, is understood. It is true, as Schiitz says, the transition
from the infinitive to ut with subj. is not a violent one 3 he compares concedo
so used Cic. Am. 5. 183 probo Tusc. 3. 3. 5; assentior Leg. 2. 5. 11. It
would be impossible to take ut multum=quam multum or quantum.

14. crispinus ε 1. 1. 120 n. minimo, ‘ at long odds.’ Crispinus offers
heavy odds that he can write more than Horace. So Palmer with Acron:
minimo provocare dicuntur ii qui in stipulatione plus {psi promittunt quam
exigunt ab adversario. Surely, however, the man who lays ‘long odds '
challenges with a great sum and not ‘ with a very little‚' and therefore we may
perhaps accept the explanation of the other 30110Ιί3313, minimo digito solent
provocare qui volunt ostendere plus esse ‘cdv-ium in suo diqico minimo quam in
alterius toto empore. Bentley read nummo. 15. accipiam : an infinitely
better reading than accipe iam τ 111 fact iam is utterly inconsistent with hora,

the lists is necessary. tabulae, sc. ceratem, for writing on with the stilus.
17. di bene fecerunt : an expression of thanks: cf. καλῶς ποιεῖν, εὖ ποιεῖν.
19. hircinis follibus, ‘goat-skin bellows' ; windbags‚ a man who prides
himself in the quantity 110 writes, produces empty nothings, mere wind.
21. ut mavis: like ut facis, ‘according to your preference for so doing.’
beatus, because he got many readers.

21. Fannius, called Quadratus by the schol„ was, as we may judge from
this passage, a bad poet, though a wordy one; he was a great card with
Horace’s bete noire Hermogenes Tigellius, and a frequent guest athis table,
where they ran down Horace together: 1. 10. 80. ultro delatis capsis
et imagine. Probably some admirer or admirers of Fannius had made him
a 111-0300131100 of a set of ornamenta] bookcases, together with a bust of himself.

22 ; Cic. ad Fam. 4. 13. 2 quod non ultro mihi Caesar detulerit ,⁶ ad Fam. 13.
55. 1 ultro ei detulerim Zeyationem. The scholiasts give other explanations.
They tell us that Fannius was childless, and that his heredipetae (legacy-hunters).
without his orders, sent his poems and busts to the public libraries. That
does not suit the use of ultro delatis, and is historically impossible ε for in the
first public library at Rome, that founded by Asinius Pollio in 38 Β.0., 1110
only 0110 existing at this time, the writings of living authors were not admitted ;
the sole exception being made 111 1110 0330 of M. Varro (Plin. H. N. 7. 30. 115).
Another scholastic explanation is that Fannius had left iu his will a direction.
that he should be burnt with his own writings ; but this is a confusion with
the account given (1. 10. 62) of CassiuS, and Fannius was now living (1. 10. 80).
