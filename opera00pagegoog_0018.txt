xii HORAOE

to 19 B.c.1 They are similar in character to the Satires
but altogether superior to them, not only in style but in
matter. They contain the ‘ ripe results of the poet's observation
of men and manners ' 2 set before us with that apparently negligent
grace which is really the result of perfect skill, and which adds so
much to the charm of good ‘ conversation ' 3 and good ‘ letters.' 4

The Ars Poetica is, as its name implies, a didactic poem giving
rules for poetical composition.

The Epodes are Horace's first attempt at writing lyric poetry.
They are an imitation of the satirical iambics of Archilochus,5
and are thus to some extent connected with the SatireS, which
were written at the same period. The bitterness of Archilochus
waS, however, entirely alien from the easy temper of Horace, and
the ‘ libellous iambics ² 6 111 which he vents imaginary spleen on
imaginary persons ⁷ are dull and uninteresting‚ but other Epodes, in
which he breaks loose from Archilochus in order to deal with happier
themeS, already show signs of his future greatness as a lyric poet.

It is on the four Books of Odes that the fame of Horace
really rests, To what extent the Odes were published and
circulated separately we cannot tell, but the division into books
almost certainly dates from Horace's time, and the arrangement of
the Odes in them is probably his own. The marks of careful
arrangement are very clear. Thus in the first Book the first three
Odes are addressed to MaecenaS, Augustus, and Virgil, while the
first nine Odes are each in a different metre, as though the poet
wished to give the reader an early proof of his varied skill. That
at the end of the Book the passion of the Cleopatra-Ode (1. 37)
should be followed by an extremely slight and cheerful drinking-

3 Horace does not seem himself to have called his Satires by that name,

’ but rather to have used the term Sermones ‘conversations' When however

he says of these poems that they ⁶ only differ from ordinary conversation in
the fact of their scanning’ (S. 1. 4. 47 nisi quod pede certo Ι differt sermoni,
sermo merus), he must not be taken too literally‚ for it is his obJ‘ect to disguise

sequently many writers, when desiring to treat a subject somewhat informally,
have put their views forward in the shape of ‘ Letters’
