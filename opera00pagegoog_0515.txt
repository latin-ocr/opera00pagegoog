was minus aptus aciatis Ι naribus horum hominum, and could not see through
Balatro's ill-natured raillery. 77. soleas poscit: Nasidienus calls for his
slippers to leave the table, in order to go out and personally see to the safe
bringing in of new dishes‚ to make up for the one that was spoilt. In the
house the Romans wore slipperS, soleae: these were taken off before lying
down at dinner3 hence demere soleas is equivalent to lying down at table3
poscere soleas, to rising from it. Plaut. Truc. 2. 4. 12 cedo soleas mihi, when
about to leave the table; the same speaker, changing his mind about going,
says, line 16, iam rediit animus, deme soleas, cedo bibam. Cf. Ep. 1. 13. 15.
videres: you might see the guests putting their heads together as they
whispered. 78. The whispering is imitated by the siqmatismua ,

81. quoque, which should follow the word it belongs to, is here somewhat
irregularly placed, as it clearly refers to laqoena, ‘ whether the wine flagon is
broken as well as the dish ' containing the lamprey. 82. The table had
been cleared when the curtains fell ; but the slaves, perhaps acting on a hint
from NasidienuS‚ had not set fresh cups before Vibidius, who, 116 thought, had
drunk as much as was good for him. 83. ridetur: impers. fletis
rerum: at pretended subjects. So vanis reram 2. 2. 25; abdita rerum
A. P. 49. Balatrone secundo, ‘ by the help of Balatro,' who invented
subjects for the guests to pretend to laugh at. The expression is a burlesque
of phrases like Iunone secunda, Marte secundo. 84. Nasidiene: the
apostrophe is also epic. mutatae frontis : a very strong gen. of quality
with a verb like redire, 1. 1. 33.

86. mazonomo, a large dish, properly a trencher, from which bread was
served (μᾶζα, νέμειν). discerpta, ‘pulled asunder,' not cut. 87. The
flesh of the crane is spoken of by Pliny, H. N. 10. 23. 60, as highly prized.
It is remarkable that grus is here masc. contrary to the ordinary rule: so
too anser is regularly masc., but vec. Bland. gives albae for which albi of most
MSS. is probably a correction. 89. avulsos: the wings of the hare
were to be separated from the loins, and separated by tearing. 90.

part of birds, Gen. 15. 8. 2. Nasidienus or his cook thought differently.
92. causae et naturas: as if Nasidienus were lecturing on some
physiologica] theme. As Virg. says of Lucretius, who wrote de Rerum
Natura, Georg. 2. 490 felix qui potuit rerum ooqnoscere causas 93. 816

Tibull. 2. 1. 80 felix cui placidus leniter adflat Amor. 95. The breath of
certain serpents was supposed to be deadly. Colum. 8. 5. 18 cavendum ne α
