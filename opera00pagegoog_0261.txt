rites by the pontiffs and vestal virgins: this word and exsiccet (ζ drain to the
dregs ³) are used to bring out the luxury and greed of the merchant-prince.
12. Syra merce. So 3. 29. 60 Tyriae merces. The phrase includes all
those products of the East which came through Syria, and especially through
the great emporium of Tyre.

13. dis came ipsis: κατ’ εἰρωνείαν Orelli. The irony is strongly brought
out by quippe: ‘because forsooth.' ter et quater, ‘three ογ four times ’ 3
δὶς καὶ τρίς. 15. olivae, cichorea, malvae, ie. the ordinary products of
a yeoman's farm. 16. leves, ‘light,’ πλε. to the digestion, cf. Epod. 2. 57.
17. frui . . . ‘mayest thou grant me (for the present), O son of Leto, to
enj0y what Ι have both with sound health, and, I pray, with mind unimpaired‚
and (in the future) to pass an old age neither . . . nor . . .' Horace has
two wisheS, each of which is twofold: (1) for the present, vigour both of body
and mind (Juv. 10. 356 orandum est ut sit mens sana in empore sano), (2)
when old age comes, that honour which should ever accompany it, and that
enj0yment of lyric song which had been the happiness of his life. The at
precor of most MSS. throws the carefully balanced sentence wholly out of gear.

ODE XXXII

‘ We are summoned. If ever, my Zyre, in Ziyhter vein I with thy aid have
ὅππῃ anythinq which ‘may survive, come now inspire me with a Latin song,

such as Alcaeus sang] of· old, the warrior-hard. Ο thou that art the ylory of
Phoebus, the deliyht of Jupiter, the solace of toil, answer me whenever I call. ’

1. poscimur. Horace had evidently been asked to write an Ode or Odes
on some subJ'ect of national interest (Latinum carmen) ; this Ode is an appeal
to his lyre by the memory of their past success in lighter subjects to aid him
in this. Whether Augustus or Maecenas made the request, and whether the
noble national lyrics at the commencement of Book 3 are the answer, is
matter of conjecture. poscimur seems to imply that those who summoned
Horace had the right to do so, The reading poscimus (followed by a comma
and governing quod) is very weak‚ and poscimur is strongly supported by
many passages in Ovid, e.g. poscimw, Aonide& Met. 5. 333. si. This use
of a clause beginning with si in appeals is very frequent. It does not imply
any doubt as to the fact, but assumes it to be a fact and founds the appeal
upon it. Cf. C. S. 37 Roma si vestrum est opus . . . datm Od. 3. 18. 5
Fauna . . . lenis incedas . . . si . . . cadi& S. 2. 6. 6. vacui sub
umbra lusimus. N otice how each word brings out ,the idea of light
careless poetry. sub umbra: grottoes or groves are the haunts of poets.
lusimus ε commonly used of the composition of playful verse, cf. 4. 9. 9 si quid
olim lusit Anacreon ,· 2. 13. 26 n. 2. quod et . . . The order of the
words seems to connect this clause with si quid, but sense rather refers it
to L. carmen, thus contrasting the nobler and more lasting Ode he contem-
plates with the lighter and more fugitive pieces he has hitherto attempted.
3. dic, ‘utter ' x the instrument is said to speak. 4. barbito. Masculine
here as in late Greek. The word has the singular privilege of possessing
three genders, ἡ βάρβιτος and τὸ βάρβιτον being also found.

5. Lesbio primum . . . It is implied that Horace hopes his Ode
will equal those of Alcaeus. See too 1. 1. 34 n. modulate: 1. 1. 25 n.
civi: emphatic. Alcaeus (flor. 611 Rc.) took a most active part in politica]
life. He was driven into exile by the popular party ς he fought both against
