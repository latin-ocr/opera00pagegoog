melius perirent. 'I'he poet shrinks from expressing what he suggests. The
whole history of the first century B.c. is the history of civil wars, which
decimated the chief families at Rome: ‘ the ranks of youth were thinned by
the crimes of their sires.' The proscriptions of Marius and Sulla, the battles
of Pharsalia :¹(B.c. 48), Philippi (B.c. 42) and Actium (3.0. 31) would be
fresh in every memory. 22. graves Persae. The Persian empire,
dating from Cyrus (B.c. 559), was destroyed by Alexander, but the Roman
poets use Persae and Medi generally of any Oriental people‚ but especially,
as here, of the Parthians who occupied what had been the Persian empire.
By defeating and destroying Crassus at Chartae (Chai-ran, Acts vii. 2) Β.ο. 53
and captui-ing the Roman standai-ds, they had made a deep impression on
the imagination of the Romans. Tbeir progress was stopped by two defeats
inflicted on them by Ventidius, legate of Antony, Β o. 39 and 38, and the
lost standards were recovered from Prahates by negotiatiom 13.c. 20. Coins
are extant with the legend, SIGNIS PARTHIGIS RECEP‘HS, and the subject is
continually referred to by Horace and other poets. Cf. Ep. 1. 18. 56 3 12. 27;
Ov. Fast. 5. 593, Virg. G. 4. 560.

the fortunes of our falling power ’ἒ ’ 26. imperi : not ‘ empire ’=a country
ruled by an emperor, but ‘ military sway,’ the proper meaning of imperium.
But cf. 4. 15. 14 n. 27. virgines sanctae. 'I'he vestal virgins, as
guarding the eternal fire of Vesta, which symbolised the eternity of Rome,
would be specially bound to pray for the safety of the state, of which they
were regarded as an essentia] portion3 cf. 3. 30. 8. minus audientem
carmina, ‘ turning a deaf ear to their litanies.' — Wickham. Carmen
(zcasmem root ΚΑΒ, ‘to sing ') is used of any formula chanted or recited.

29. partes. Often in the plural of that which is allotted to any one,
‘ task ’ ; cf. A. P. 193 ; Cic. ad Fam. 11. 5. 3 tuum est hoc muna-3, tuae partes.
31. nube . . .: firom Hom. Il. 5. 186 νεφέλῃ εἰλυμένος ὤμους; to Apollo,
the Sun-god‚ the phrase is especially applicable. The ‘ cloud ' is a radiant
one; cf. Rev. x. 1 ; νεφέλη φωτινή Mt. xvii. 5. 32. augur, τῖε. as god
of Delphi and eracles. Auqur is strictly one who interprets the cries of
birds, from avis, and qam-vste, ‘ chatter‚’ Gk. Ὑηρύω.

33. Erycina ridens, ‘sweetly-smiling (φιλομμειδής) queen of Eryx!

7. 21 ; 11. 6 3 4. 6. 28. 39. Mauri peditis, Some read Marsi on the
ground that the Moors and Ν umidians were all horsemen‚ but there is no
reason to assume that scot-soldiers were never employed by them. Orelli
takes peditis: ‘unhorsed,' and urges that this adds force to the picture and
gives a reason for the fierceness (acer vultus) which the Moor exhibite, but the
