vi PREFAOE

My most hearty thanks are due to Professors A„ Palmer and
A. S. Wilkins who with rare generosity placed their editions
at my disposal. As far as could be I have treated them
tenderly, and it was only after practising with the pruning-
knife on my own productione that I began to deal with theirS.
At any rate I have endeavoured not to misrepresent them or
obtrude my views on theirs, and in the few instances where
some modificatione have been necessary they have been either
indicated or are unimportant.

Lastly I owe a large debt to the printers and their excellent
“ Readers '' for their constant skill and care, which only those
who. have had to pass a book of this nature through the press

can fully appreciate.
