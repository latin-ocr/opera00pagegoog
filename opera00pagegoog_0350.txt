322 HORACE 130οΚ 111

ne semper contempleris, ‘be not ever gazing wistfully at‚’ te. from Rome.
With ‘ne in prohibitions addressed to a particular person the perf. subj. is
usual, but would be impossible here where the act spoken of is continuous.
Some put only a comma after morae, and render ‘come quickly so as not to
be . . . ,’ but this is less simple. Tibur, 16 1111163 ΝΕ. of Rome, and
Tusculum (Telegoni iuga, cf. Epod. 1. 29 n.)‚ 10 1111163 s.E.‚ both on the
sides of 111113, were (see Mart. 4. 64) visible from Rome, and especially from
Maecenas’ lofty house, see lines 9, 10.

9. fastidiosam . . . ‘quit the plenty that but palls ' 3 see 3. 1. 36 11. 10.
molem . . . ‘the palace that towers to the clouds.² Cf. Shak. The Tempest
IV. i. 152 ‘The cloud-capt towers, the gorgeous palaces.' The reference is
to the so-called turris Maecenatis on the Esquiline, from which Nero afterwards
watched the burning of Rome, and which had a commanding view over Rome
(see lines 11, 12) and the neighbourhood. 11.·mirari . . . This terse
description of a great capital as observed from some point of vantage is
inimitable. The wealth, the smoke, the riches, the roar of London, as seen
say from St. Paul’s, might well in their combined effect make the beholder
‘ marvel ' (mirari). 14. mundae. The adjective indicates the presence of
taste but the absence of extravagance. Horace defines mundus (S. 2. 2. 65),
as applied to a host, as a just mean between luxurious excess and sordid neglect.
The word thus meaning not only ‘simple ’ but ‘elegant ’ is difficult to translate ε
perhaps here ‘simple' will suffice, though it only expresses half the word.
sub Lare, ‘beneath the roof.' 15. aulaeis: see S. 2. 8. 54 n. ostro
refers to the purple covering of the couches, 16. sollicitam . . . ‘have
smoothed the wrinkles from the brow of care ’ ; cf. S. 2. 2. 125. explicuere
with plerumque, ‘ have often,’ ie. before now.

17. clarus occultum. The antithesis is somewhat forced. clarae,
‘glowing'3 occultum, ‘hidden‚' zie, previously. Andromedae pater:
Cepheus. All the stars mentioned rise in July. 18. Procyon: Προκύων
(111 Latin Antemnis), the constellation which rises before the Doqstar. For
y in words borrowed from Gk. cf. 1. 16. 5 n. furit and vesani both refer
to the fierce heat of the dog-days, cf. 3. 7. 6 insana, of ‘wild’ weather.
20. dies referente 316003, ⁶ bringing round the days of drought.' siccos:
in an emphatic position because of the double meaning assigned to it, (1)=
when rain is rare, (2) :when drink is acceptable.

22. horridi, ‘shaggy.’ A country covered with wood (silvae) and thickets
(dumeta) is horridus (cf. 4. 5. 26 Germania horrida), and therefore the same
epithetis applied to ‘ the woodland god‚' Silvanus. 23. caretque . . . ‘ and
the slumbering bank (13.6. of the river mentioned line 22) is untroubled by the
wandering windS.’ 25. tu . . . σὺ δέ. Τ116 position of the pronoun
marks the antithesis between Maecenas' activity and 1116 repose which the
season suggests (lines 17-24). 26. et urbi . . . ‘and anxious for the
city dread the plots (quid parent) of the Seres . . .’ The Seres (cf. 1. 12.
56) stand for any remote Eastern people. 27. regnata Cyro Bactra,
‘ Bactria where Cyrus ruled‚' lit. ‘reigned over by Cyrus! For construction
cf. 2. 6. 11 11. ; and for the kingdom of Cyrus 1. 2. 22 11. 28. Tanaisque
discors. The river is put for the dwellers by the river, i.e. the Scythae, 366
3. 8. 23 11. discors, ‘rebellious’

29. prudens :prevalens ‘ in his providence.' 30. caliginosa: the size
of the word expresses the utterly impenetrable character of the darkness which
‘Q ' (pfflmlt) the future from human gaze; caligo is ‘ a darkness that
