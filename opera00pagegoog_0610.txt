3. 80 seq. 134. signo lagoenae ε wine flasks were always sealed up ; cf.
Mart. 9. 87. 7 ‘nuuc signat meus anulus Zayoeuam. lagoena and lagona are
both legitimate forms, but not layeua. 135. rupem: S. 2. 3. 56-6Ο;

Α. Ρ. 459. 136. opibus: some say=0p3‚ but it is doubtful whether even ·

in verse the two words can be thus interchanged. In od. 3. 3. 28 Hectoreis
opibus is ‘by the might of H.': in Ep. 1. 10. 36 perhaps ‘resources’ is a
better rendering than ‘aid ' 3 cf. Cic. ad Att. 9. 16 Cacsar iam opes ‘meaa nou
ut superioribus litterae, opem expectat. 137. elleboro: cf. S. 2. 3. 83 n. ;
A. P. 300 n. bilemque: bile, especially when black (μέλαινα χολή), was
considered to cause frenzy or melancholy 3 cf. Plaut. Capt. 3. 4. 64 atra bilis
ayitat homiuem ‚· Cic. TuS0. 3. 5. 11 quem uos furorem, μελαγχολίαν illi
vocant. Sir A. Grant (Ar. Eth. Nic. 7. 7. 8) says ‘With the moderns the term
mdaucholy is restricted to the cold and deJected mood: while the ancients

‚ much more commonly applied the term μελαγχολικός to denote warmth, passion,

and eccentricity of genius: cf. Ar. Probl. 11. 38 τὸ τῇ φαντασίᾳ ἀκολουθεῖν
ταχέως τὸ μελαγχολικὸν εἶναι ἐστίν.’ ’ 138. pol: 1. 7. 92 n.

141-144. Siaethly, (and iu all soberuess) the riyht occupatiou for a ‘man of
my years is to aare less about harmo‘ny iu verse& aud more about a true har-
mouy of ἰήϊε. 141. sapere, ue. the study of philosophy, not as in linc 128
of a knowledge of the laws of poetry. nugis are the ludicra of l. 1. 10.
142. pueris primarily with concedere, but supplied again after tempes-
tivum, ‘to give up to boys the sport which is seasonable for them ': cf. 1. 14.
36. 143. sequi, ‘to try to find ' ε A. P. 240 carmen sequar. fldibUS‚
ablative, as we see from Virg. Ecl. 10. 51 camina pastoris Siculi modulabor
avena ,· the lyre plays the tune, by which the rhythm of the verse is regulated.
ao non is used rather than et uon where the meaning is ‘ and therefore not ' ;
cf. 1. 10. 46 ; S. 2. 3. 135. 144. numerosque modosque: cf. l. 18. 59 3
P1at. Prot. 326 Β ὁ βίος τοῦ ἀνθρώπου εὐρυθμίας τε καὶ εὐαρμοστίας δεῖται.

145-154. Hence I set myseff to ‘reflect upon the truc cure for the common
disease of avariae. 146. sitim, as having the dropsy3 cf. Od. 2. 2. 13.
lymphae: used for the water of a spring in od. 2. 3. 12 ; 11. 2Ο; 3. 11. 26 ;
13. 16 ; S. 1. 5. 24 (as in Lucr., Virg. and Ovid): for the water-nymphs S. 1.
5. 97. LVMPHIEIS corresponding to ΝΤΜΦΑΙΣ appears in a bilingual in-
scription in the N aples Museum (G. I. L. 1. 1238), but it is doubtful whether
the old Latin lumpa (cf. limpidus) had originally anything to do with nympha,
and perhaps it is only popular etymology which connected it with that word
—in early Latin transliterated as uumpa-and so led to the spelling lympha.
147. quod, ‘seeing that‚' not directly dependent upon faterier. Horace
returns so frequently to the vice of avarice that it is clear that he considered
it one of the most common failings of his time: cf. 1. 1. 53. 149. mon·
strata, ‘prescribed.' Virg. Aen. 4. 636 mou-strata piacula ,· G. 4. 549 mou·
stratas aras,· Juv. 10. 363. 151. curarier‚ ‘to be treated,’ of course not
‘to be cured.' For the form of the inf. cf. 2. 1. 94 n. audieras, from the
talk of people in general, who are apt to think that wealth means happiness :
cf. 1. 1. 53. 152. donarent: past in accordance with the principle that
even in stating a general truth, the tense of the verb on which another depends
determines the sequence ; cf. Cic. de off. 2. 1. 1 quem ad modum officia du-
cerentur ab honestate . . . satis explicatum arbitror ,· Roby 1508, S. G. 620.
154. plenior-:ditior 3 Od. 2. 12. 24 plenas Arabum domos.

155-1'79. If wealth made you wisc, you ouyht to devote yourself to this.
