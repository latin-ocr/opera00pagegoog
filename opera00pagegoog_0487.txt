SATIRE IV
Catius oa Ooolcery. DA‘rF. t—about 32 13.0.

Horace relates how he met one CatiuS, who was hurrying home to commit
to writing certain precepts on gastronomy, which he had Just heard from a
person whose name he refuses to revea13 he, however, recites the precepta
themselves at length, 12-86. Of these, roughly, 12-34 refer to the gustatio,
35-46 to the masa prima, 48-69 to drink and sauceS, 70-75 to the mensa
secunda, and 76-87 to cleanh‘ness. When he has concluded Horace seigns
rapturous admiration, and implores Catius to introduce him to the author.
Ennius had written a poem in imitation of the Ἡδυφαγητικά of Archestratus,
and Varro a satire περὶ ἐδεσμάτων. ⁶

To the question who Catius was different answers have been given. (1) It
has been supposed by some that he was the Catius Insuber mentioned by
Cicero (ad Fam. 15. 16. 1) as an Epicurean writer then lately deceased, and
of whom Quintilian, 10. 1. 124, says: in Epicureis levis quidem sed non i‘n·
iucundus tamen auctor est Catius. This Catius must have died before 44 B.c.,
and there seems no reason why Horace should introduce him here. (2) Comm.
Cruq. tells us that M. Catius was an Epicurean who wrote four bookS‚ dc
rerum natura ct de summo bono, but on line 47 the same commentator says ε
inridet eum quod de opere pistorio in suo libro scm'psit de se ipso .· haec primus
invenit et coqnovic Catius Miltiade-3. Hence Orelli has put forward the theory
that Catius was one Miltiades, who was a freedman of Cicero’s Catius, and had
taken the name of his patronae, in addition to his own, as was customary. (3)
Manso's view, that Catius is a disguise for Matius (see Od. 2. 12. 13 11.;
Palmer Pref. p. xvii.) is generally discarded and yet seems certainly true.
This C. Matius was a friend of Julius Caesar, and afterwards of Octavian.
He was also intimate with Cicero, and, what is very striking, with Trebatius
(cf. Cic. ad Fam. 11. 27 ; 11. 28 ; ad Att. 9. 15). He was also noted for his
endeavours to raise gastronomy to an art ; cf. Columella 12. 4. 2 tum demum
‘nostri yencris postquam a bellis otium suit quasi quoddam tributum victui
humano conferre non dediynati sunt at M. Ambivius et Maenas Licinius tum
etiam O. Matius quibus studium suit pistoris et coqui nec minus cellarii dili-
qentiam suis praeceptis instruere ,· 12. 44. 1 quae Ο. Matius diliqentissime
persecutus est . . . illi emim propositum fait urbanas mensas et lauta convivia
insti-uere, libros tres edidit quos inscripsit viminibus Coei et Cetarii et
Salqamarii : ⁶ the Cook,’ ‘ the Fishmonger, ’ ‘ the Picklemaker.’ His unknown

teacher (lines 10-11) may reasonably be regarded as a figment into whose lips
he puts his own wisdom, cf. ‘Mrs. Harris?
