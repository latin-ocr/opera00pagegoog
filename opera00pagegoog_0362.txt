38. testis, sc. est. For the adj. Metaurum see 1. 15. 10 n. The

defeated Hasdrubal B.0. 207 and cut off the reinforcements he was bringing to
his brother Hannibal. 39. pulcher. Cf. 4. 2. 47, ‘ brilliant? 40. dies
is to be taken literally of the day when Hasdrubal was defeated 3 tenebris
metaphorically of the gloom which had hung over Italy since the disasters of
Trebia, Trasimene, and Cannae. See too 4. 5. 5 n. on luce-m.

41. qui primus . . . ‘which first smiled with cheering victory since the
day when (ut) the dread African careered . . .' adorea is an archaie
word used to add dignity3 cf. 1. 34. 5 n. It is said to be derived from
ador, ‘grain,' because a largess of corn was distributed to troops after a
victory. alma=quae alit, ‘fostering‚’ ‘cheering.' 42. dirus Afer. dirus
is the standard epithet of Hannibal, cf. 2. 12. 2 n. For ut, with perf. ind.‚

45. secundis . . . ‘with ever prosperous endeavours the youth of Rome

49. perfidus. See 3. 5. 33 n. 50. luporum. The Romans are the
true ‘ wolfs litter.’ 51. ultro: this word, connected with ultra, is used
of actions which go beyond anything which might reasonably have been ex-
pected, which are needless, uncalled·for‚ and the like. It here indicates that
for stags to attack wolves was not only folly but needless‚ gratuitous folly.
Cf. S. 2. 7. 40 ultro insectere of one who goes so far as to lecture another
when he is worse himself. opimus triumphus, ‘ rarest triumph.’ The
phrase is invented on the analogy of spolia opium, spoils taken by a general
in personal combat with the general of the enemy, and said to have been
only thrice won—(l) by Romulus, (2) by A. Cornelius Cossus, 13.c. 426, (3)
by M. Claudius Marcellus, B.0. 222. 52. fallere, ‘to elude.'

53. cremato fortis ab Ilio ι fortis in strict grammar goes with pertulit
but in sense with the words between which it is placed : disaster, as the next

omnim aq. such as Cannae, or (2) ‘ the
cutting off ’ of a bough: no English word will bear this double sense. The stanza
is perhaps unrivalled as a specimen of Horace’s um'que power osterse and graphio
expression. 60. ducit, ⁶ draws,’ ‘ deriveS,' goes grammatically with qens, as
do the whole two lines, but the skill of the comparison is shown in the fact
that if ilex be taken as the nom. to ducit each word is equally applicable.
