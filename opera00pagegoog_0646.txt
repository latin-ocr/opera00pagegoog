618 HORAOE γ ΑΒΕ»

est nonamque edita post hiemem. But Horace refers here not so much to the
time spent upon the composition, as to the interval to be allowed to lapse
between the completion of a poem and its publication. Of. Quintilian's
dedicatory letter to Tryphon: quibus componendis . . . paulo plns quam
biennium . . . impendi ; . . . usus deinde Horati consilio, quiin arte poetica
suadet, ne praecipiteinr editio . . . dabam iis otium, ut ‘refrigerato inventionis
amore diliqenter ‘repetitos tamquam lector perpenderem. 389. membranis :
usually membrana denotes the parchment case or wrapping of the papyrus roll,
which formed the liber (cf. Ellis on Catull. 22. 7) ; and so Kiessling takes the
word here (and S. 2. 3. 2), the finished poem in its envelope being put away
nine years before publication. 390. nescit . . . reverti: cf. Ep. 1. 18. 71.

391-40'7. The power of poetry is shown by the stories of orpheus and
Amphion: it laid thefoundations of civilization .· and men were ron-sed to war
and tauyht wisdom by its straina 391. silvestres, τῖε. when ‘wild in
woods the noble savage ran ’ ; cf. S. 1. 3. 99 seq. saoer=sacerdos Threicius
of Virg. Aen. 6. 645. interpres: Eur. Rhes. 936 μυστηρίων τε τῶν
ἀπορρήτων φαναῖς Ι ἔδειξεν Ὀρφεύς, and Plato (Protag.316 D) mentions him with
Musaeus as having introduced τελετάς καὶ χρησμῳδίας. Ηο is the type of the
true seer, who is inspired to declare the will of heaven, and who is at once
prophet, priest, and poet. 392. caedibus: Aristoph. Ran. 1032 Ὀρφεὺς
μὲν γὰρ τελετάς θ’ ἡμῖν κατέδειξε φόνων τ’ ἀπέχεσθαι. victu foedo:
cannibalism. 393. tigres: the beasts appear following Orpheus first in
Eur. Bacch. 564 ἐν ταῖς Ὀλύμπου θαλάμαις, ἔνθα ποτ’ Ὀρφεὺς κιθαρίζων1
ξύναγεν δένδρεα Μούσαις, ξύναγεν θῆρας ἀγρώτας. Cf. too Od. 1. 12. 11 n.
rabidosque ε so many of the best MSS. including vet. Bland. Many however
give rapidos, but the use of the word=‘ravening’ is not justified by its

urbis has 11111011 111010 authority than arcis, and isg clearly right. The arx
Thebana was founded by CadmuS‚ hence called Cadmea, while (Pausanias 9. 5.

1-3) Amphion and Zethus built the lower city. For Amphion cf. Od. 3. 11. 2
movit Amphion lapides canendo.

395. blanda: cf. Ep. 2. 1. 135. 396. sapientia, predicate, with the
infinitives in apposition‚ ‘this was wisdom, viz. to . . . ,’ and it is implied
that poetry was originally of this gnomic and didactic character, ey. in the
Hesiodic poems. 397. publica . . . Horace follows the division of the
Roman law: cf. Gaius 2. 2 summa itaque ‘rernm divisio in duos amiculas
diducitur : nam aliae sunt divini iuris, aliae. humani. divini iuris sunt
veluti ‘res sacrae et reliyiosae. 10. hae autem quae humani iuris suni ant
publicae sunt ant privatae. 398. concubitu vago, ‘ promiscuous unions.’ ’
The Epicurean conception of the early history of man upon the earth, which
Horace has in view here, is given fully in Lucr. 5. 925-1457. On much of
it Darwin’s Descent of Man furnishes an interesting commentary. maritis,
‘ the wedded '; Dig. 24. 1. 52 inber maritos nihil coitur. 399. ligno:
aereis enim tabulis antiqui non sunt nsi, sed roboreis‘. in has incidebant Ze9e8,
unde adhuc Athenis Zeynm tabulae ἄξονες vocantur—Porph.

400. sio, i.e. as civilisation grew. honor: but in line 69 honos.
honos is far more common in Cicero and Livy than honor, and is the
only form used by Virgil. Horace, Ovid, Tacitus and the later poets use the
two forms indiscriminately. vatibus : Horace is thinking of mythical poets
’ like Linus, Orpheus, Musaeus. 401. insignis: not an epithet of Homerus
