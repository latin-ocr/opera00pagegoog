sumn vt NOTES 471

16. 29. super his, ‘ in addition to these '; a very rare use of super, cf. 2.
7. 78. 111 prose it would be super haec, but even this is rare. 4. bene
est, ‘1 am satisfied‚' καλῶς ἔχει. 5. Maia nate: Mercury‚ the prosper·
ing god, κερδῷος, ἐριούνιος, 2. 3. 25 11. propria, ‘fast,' ‘inalienable';
cf. Od. 2. 2. 22 11.

6. ratione mala, ‘by any evil way.² 7. vitm, ‘excessa' 2. 2. 21.
eulpa, ‘thriftlessness‚' ‘neglect,' a meaning the word had in juridical Latin.
8. veneror t offer a prayer 3 Cic. ad Fam. 6. 7. 2 qui multa deos venerati sint.
9. denormat, ‘spoils the shape os.' 10. quae=aliqua. si quae is perhaps
archaic for si qua, like si qui for si quis .· cf. Ter. Heaut. Ptol. 44 si quae
laboriosa est, ad me curritur : see 1. 4. 93 ; Madvig de Fin. 1. 8. 26. 11.
mercennarius: a labourer for hire. The sentence would naturally be illi
mercennario qui, but the attraction is like illi, scripta quibus comoedia prisca
viris est 1. 10. 16. 12. illum ipsum: that very field where he was
working, and found the treasure. aravstz: tilled it as his own. 13.
Hercule: treasure-trove was generally credited to Mercury, cf. 2. 3. 25 11.,
but the Italian Hercules, the god of the enclosed homestead (from hercere),
was the god of property and gain, and it was common to vow a tithe of spoil
or profit to him (cf. pars Herculanea Plaut. Bacch. 4. 4. 11 and Mommsen,
Hist. 1. c. xii). gratum ε masc. probably 3 cf. Ep. 1. 11. 22 tu quamcum-
que deus tibi fortunaverit horam Ι ‚orata sume manu. But many take it as
nent. == ‘received with thanks‚' a passive meaning which gratus often has.

16. montes: the Sabine hills, in a valley between which Horace's farm
lay; cf. Epa, -1. 16. 5 and note. et in arcem ex urbe: the whole point
would be lost if we did not take these words closely together. The line
means ‘when I have moved to my mountains‚ and exchanged the city for a
citadeL' Horace could call his villa an αντ for two reasons—(1) it was up in
the mountain, and mountains are often called arces; (2) it was really a fort
of refuge to him from city life, as a citadel in a city. 17. quid prius ε
what subJect before my mountains and my citadel, and the peaceful life I lead
there. saturis t abl. of instr. Musaque pedestri, ‘my prosaic Muse ’ 3
311 admirable epithet to describe the homely lauguage of the Satires, which
Horace calls, Ep. 2. 1. 251, sermones Ι repentes per humum. Horace uses the
word pedester three times always in the metaphorical sense it bears here:
pedestres historiae Od. 2. 12. 9 are prose histories: sermo pedester A. P. 95,
is homely language. The Greeks used πεζός 111 the same way 3 Luc. de Conscr.
Hist. 8 describes a bombastic history as πεζή τις ποιητική : so πεζῇ μοι φράσον
Ar. Frag. 713 ‘tell me in prose.' The metaphor is from a person soberly
jogging on on font, contrasted with the dashing pace of a mounted cavalier.
Quint. 10. 1. 81 remarks of Plato that he rises multum supra. prosam orationem
et quam pedestrem Graeci vocant.

18. nec mala . . . t a reason why he should sing his country life above
all things. ⁶(Here) no ceremony worries me to death! ambitio means, not
what we call ambition, but the duties necessary in town to keep up a certain
position in society3 cf. Ov. Met. 11. 765 inambitiosa colebat Ι rura. plum-
beus, ‘leaden-hued': the colour of the sky clouded by Auster is attributed
to the wind itself ; so albus Notus Od. 1. 7. 15. Others render ‘oppressive‚'
giving a sense of leaden weight to the atmosphere ; both ideas may be com-
bined in ‘lead-an! 19. Libitinae: cf. Ep. 2. 1. 49 11. quaestus, ‘a
source of gain to ’z autumn, the proverbially unhealthy scason, brought in grist
to Libitina, in the number of victims to disease ; cf. Od. 2. 14. 15 fnestra per
