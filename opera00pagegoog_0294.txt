266 HORACE BooK 11

measures, In the present case however Horace found the theme uncongenial,
the Ode bearing in its stiffness and constraint every mark of being ‘made

to order’ (invita Minerva). On the other hand Odes 1-6 of Book 3 are
brilliant examples of what he could do under similar circumstances.

1. iam . . . relinquent. The decline of the number of small holdings
in Italy, and the almost total extinction of the yeoman claSS, which had
formed the strength of the Roman legions, was at this time a most difficult
political problem. Among the causes which brought it about are (1)
the destruction of property and death or ruin of thousands of small pro-
prietors during a century of civil war, (2) the increasing number of wealthy
capitalists at Rome who purchased large estates which they turned into parks,
preserveS, pastures and the like, (3) the vast increase in the number of slaves,
acquired by foreign conquest, which made it possible to work such vast
estates, (4) the fact that owing to large imports of agricultural produce
from all quarters of the world, much land in Italy could not be cultivated so
as to leave a margin of profit. regiae moles, ‘princely piles.' Roman
‘villas’ seem to have covered an incredible space of ground3 cf. Pliny's
account of his own two, Ep. 2. 17, and 5. 6 ; Τ30. Α1111. 3. 53 villarum infinita
spatia. 3. Lucrino lacu. The Lucrine lake close to Baiae is selected as
the best known instance of a large lake. 4. stagna, ‘ ponds‚' cle. fishponds,
piscinae. The Roman epicures made a special study of fish ; the literature o'f
the empire teems with allusions to the subject 3 in Cicero's time even men of
talent and position such as Crassus, Hortensius and Lucullus devoted their re-
tirement to the rearing of mullet, etc. ; cf. Cic. ad Att. 1. 19 3 2. 1. platanus
caelebs, ‘the unwedded plane.’ caelebs : 4. 5. 30 n. platanus: 2. 11. 13 11.

5. evincet, ‘will drive out,’ cf. 4. 5. 22 edomuit. violaria . . .
narium: Horace selects the ‘violet,’ ‘myrtle,' etc„ because owing to their
scent and fragrance they were used at banquets ; they are typical of luxury as
contrasted with usefulness. 6. copia narium ε lit. ‘wealth of the nostrils,’

a bold expression: ‘ abundance of sweet-scented plants.’ 8. domino
priori. Ethic dative. 9. spissa ramis: because the laurel can be cut
into any shape and when so cut grows very thick and compact. 10. ictus,

‘ darts‚' i.e. of the sun's rays ; the particular meaning to be given to the word
is determined by the addition of fervidos. non ita, ⁶ not so ² ε ‘ far
differently ' ; litotes. 11. praescriptum, sc. est, ‘was it ordained.’
intonsi Catonis auspicum, ‘by the example of unshaven Cato! It was
the special duty of a general to take ‘the auspices,' and the army was said to
fight under his ‘ auspices ’ ; hence auspicia == ‘leading‚' ‘ example.' Cato here
is not the younger Cato (as 2. 1. 24), but Cato the Censor who died B.c. 149,
after a long life spent in trying to stem the tendencies of the age. He
is called intonsus because as an ,outward sign of his conservative views he
continued to wear a beard after the old Roman fashion, cf. l. 12. 42; Juv.
4. 103 barbato φερέ ‘a primitive monarch ’ ; 5. 30 capillato consule ‘ an ancient
consul.’ Barbers were introduced at Rome B.c. 300.

13. census, ‘incomess' It was the duty of the censors to ‘ assess ' (censere)
' the value of each ¹citizen’s property, partly with a view to taxation, partly
that he might be registered in the proper ‘class ' for voting in the comitia
centuriata. Hence censusz‘wealth,' fincome.' 14. commune: a rare
use of the neut. adj.=7·o κοινόν ‘ the public treasury.' decempedis:
the regular instrument used by ayrimensores in measuring land. Here
the size of the rule suggests the size of the portico which required it, but
