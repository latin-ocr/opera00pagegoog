ODE XVIII

An Ode to Faunus as the god of the country, praying that he will protect
the poet who reverences him, and describing the celebration of his festival.
The regular Faunalia were on Feb. 13 ; cf. 1. 4. 11 ; Ov. Fast. 2. 193'.

4. alumnis, ‘nurslings‚' ‘the young of the fiocks.' alumnus is really the
present part. pass.. of alo, the termination being the Gk. -όμενος, cf. Vertumnus,
terminus, antemna (1. 14. 6 11.). 5. si . . . ‘if at the year’s fulfilment a
tender kid is sacrificecl (to thee) . . .' The use of siis common in supplication 3
the favour is only asked {f something has been done to deserve it, si however
expressing no doubt, but it rather being assumed that something has been so
done, cf. 1. 32. 1 11. pleno anno, ‘at the year’s fulfilment‚' tle. when the
full time year by year comes round for thy festival ; cf. per eoeaotos annos 3.
22. 6. Orelli explains pleno, ‘ coming to its end ' ue. on the Nones of December,

tibi, ‘in thine honour‚' so too line 14.

13. inter audaces . . . Perhaps Horace is reproducing a belief or saying
current among country people about the festival. Kiessling says that

Faunus 13 the same as Lupercus=qui lupos arcet. 14. spargit . . . For
the leaves falling in December, cf. Epod. 11. 5 December . . . silvis honorem

decutit. 15. gaudet . . . ‘the delver delights to have thrice stamped
on his foe the earth! Horace brings before us the picture of a rustic who has
just brought down his foot after the execution (pepulisse perf„ cf. 3. 4. 51 n.)
of the dance, and stands exulting in his performance: invisam suggests
that he has thrown extra vigour into the dance, because it gives him an
opportunity of paying off his old grudge against the earth, which gives him so
much trouble. 16. ter: because there was a triple beat in the dance;
cf. 4. 1. 28, and tripudiare. Notice the assonance in pepulisse pede, ter

terram.

ODE XIX

An Ode written on Murena (see 2. 10 Intr.) being elected an Augur. It is
assumed that a feast is to be given, and that Telephus has been elected to be
⁴ master of the feast ' ; Horace begins by reproaching him with discussing curious
antiquarian points and saying not a word about arrangements for the banquet
(lines 1-8), and then by a dramatic change plunges into an account of the feast.
