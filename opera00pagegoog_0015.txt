INTRODUOTION ix

him in his palace on the Esquiline. From this time until his
death, which occurred on the 27 th of November 8 Β.ο., a few weeks
after that of Maecenas, the poet and his patron lived on terms of
extreme intimacy and Horace takes a marked place as one of the
notable figures in Roman society.

Of his life, however, there is little to relate. He, was a man
who infinitely preferred repose and comfort to rank and distinction.
Maecenas presented him with a small farm among the Sabine hills
a little north-east of Tibur (Tivoli), and this Sabine farm was dear
to him as the apple of his eye.1 He is never weary of referring to
its charms 3 he loved to retire to it from Rome, and he constantly
contrasts the delights of his peaceful life there with the worry and
turmoil and endless engagements of the capital. In Rome itself
he contented himself with an extremely modest household‚2 partly
because his independent spirit made him unwilling to accept too
much from his patron, partly because he had a genuine dislike of

’ ostentation and the inconveniences which it entails. His ideal in

life was a modest competence and the ability to do as you like.
To lie in bed until ten, then to write or read, to play a game at
ball, to bathe, to dine at ease, to stroll round the Circus or the
Forum in the evening listening to fortune-tellers and cheapjacks 3
—these were delights in his judgment to which kings and courts
could afford nothing equal. Even when pressed by Augustus to
accept the distinguished position of his private secretary, he refused
to sacrifice his freedom 3 and the refusal was accepted without irri-
tation by the emperor, while Suetonius quotes a letter in which the
master of the world good-humouredly contrasts the poet's haughty
reserve with his own humble entreaties and offers of friendship.4
Throughout life he. took a keen interest in philosophy and
especially in ethics, questions connected with morals being con-
tinually discussed by him. His own tastes and habits were
naturally Epicurean and ‘ a sleek-skinned porker from the pen
of Epicurus ' ⁵ is his jesting description of himself, while such
maxims as caspe diem and dona praesentis cape laetus horae
abound in his writings and are illustrated in his life. On the
other hand he is never tired of jibing at the crabbed and para-
doxical teaching of the Stoics, whose typical ‘ wise man ' he
delights to portray as a typical fool. But in spite of this he
