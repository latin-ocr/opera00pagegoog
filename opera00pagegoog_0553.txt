φίλους ἀγαθοὺς κτήσασθαι, but whereas Socrates there means to say ‘the times
are so bad, that a small service is enough to secure a man's friendship,' Horace's
thought seems to be rather that when a good man is in want, his demands are not
likely to be exorbitant, and hence it will not cost much to secure his friendship.

position, not, as Orelli, at the knees of Caesar. In the Mon. Ancyr. (p. '84
Momms.) Augustus says Parthos trium exercituum Romanorum spolia et siqua
reddere mihi supplicesque amicitiam populi Romani petere coeyi. For the
surrender of the standards of Crassus 20 B.c., cf. Od. 1. 2. 22 n. For Prahates

EPISTLE XIII

ThisEpistle is nominally addressed to a certain Vinius, who has been charged
with the delivery of some of Horace's poems to Augustus. From the Jest in
line 8 it is clear that his cognomen was Asina, or perhaps (as Porphyrion calls
him) Asella; the more usual form of the name being however Asellus (6.9.
Claudius Asellus, Cic. de Orat. 2. 64. 258; Annius AselluS, Cic. in Verr. Act.
2. 1. 41, 104). From his possession of three names it is clear that he was not
a slave: on the other hand the tone, which Horace adopts in addressing him,
shows that he was not, as some have supposed, a friend of the Emperor:
possibly he was one of the five yeomen farmers on Horace’s Sabine estate (1.
14. 3). The real purpose of the letter was doubtless to indicate to Augustus
that Horace had no intention to thrust his trifles upon him, when not in the
humour for them. It has been generally assumed that the volumina contained
the first three books of the Odes, which were published together probably in
23 Β.ο. (but see wilkins).

1-9. Give my ‘colmes Vinius, to Auyustus, 'tf you find he is in the humour
for them, but do not auuoy him by obtrusiveness. If the burden ie too much
for you, drop it rather than deliver it clumsily. 2. reddes: cf. 1. 10. 44 n.
3. validus: Augustus was always a valetudinarian (Suet. Aug. 81
yravee et periculosas valetudines per omnem vitam aliquot expertus est), and
had several serious illnesses at this time of his life. Cf. S. 2. 1. 18 uisi dextro
tempore, Flacci Ι verba per attentam nou ibunt Caesaris aurem ; Ov. Trist. 1.
