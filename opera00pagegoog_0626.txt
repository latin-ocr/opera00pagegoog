treatinq his characters does not deserve the name of poet. Trayedy and
comedy have each their appropriate style, thouqh sometimes they seem to pass
into each other. A successful play must touch the feelinys of the audienee,
and for this tanyaaye well adapted to the position and character of the person,-
aqes ‘mast be employed. 86. descriptas, ‘ marked out,' assigned to tragedy
and comedy respectively. vices seems never to mean ⁵ partS,' the transla-
tion often given to it here. Comparing Od. 4. 7. 3 mutat terra vices we see
that vices may denote the states into which a thing passes by change, as well
as the changes themselves. Here it is ‘the differences.’ operumque
colores is added to explain vices: 61. 11116 236, and S. 2. 1. 60 vitae color.
We must say ‘style ' or ‘tona' 88. pudens prave, ‘ from a false shame.’
90. privatis, i.e. suited to daily life : a shocking tragedy in the life 01 6 king
ought not to be described in verse suited to the ordinary affairs of a simple
citizen. 91. cena Thyestae ε the story 01 Thyestes, tricked by 1115
brother Atreus into eating the flesh of his own two sons, is told by Aeschylus,
Agam. 1517-1536‚ and was the subJ'ect of a tragedy by Varius, the friend of
Horace, which according to Quint. 10. 1. 98 cuilibet Graecarum comparari potest.

92. This line has been transposed to after line 98 by L. Mffller, and re-
Jected by Lehrs and Ribbeck. ‘ After the negative considerations mentioned

every style should keep to the place which through the historical development

93. et comoedia, ‘ even comedy‚' as well as tragedy. 94. Chremes, a
name borne by old men in the Andria, Phormi0‚ Hautontimorumenus of Terence.
The reference here is probably to the severe language 01 Chremes in Haut. 5. 4.
Horace uses the word 01 a miser in Epod. 1. 33, borrowing it from some un-
known comedy. Perhaps the name was applied to old men from a belief in
the absurd old etymology ‘ a χρέμπτεσθαι screare, quia senes screare solent?
It is really connected with χρεμ·ίζω ‘to snort‚‘ and yrim, etc. delitigat ι
'only found here. For the form cf. Od. 1. 3. 13 11.

95. plerumque, ‘ often‚' as in line 14. tragicus ‘in a tragedy,' like
Davus comicas in S. 2. 5. 91: cf. Cio. in Ρ15. 20. 47 trayico alo Oreste et
Athamante dementiorem ,· Caec. ap. Cic. Lael. 26. 99 comicos stultos senes.

Plays were written about him by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides Agathou,
Ennius, and Accius, He was wounded by Achilles and finally cured by him
with the rust of the spear which wounded him, according to the oracle he
received at Delphi ὁ τρώσας καὶ ἰάσεται. Euripides in a play, which was
mercilessly satirised by Aristophanes in the Achamians, introduces him as
seeking the aid of Agamemnon in rags and squalor, and he became a stock
example of fallen greatness. Peleus was banished from Aegina by his
father Aeacus for the murder of 1115 half-brother Phocus, and fied to Phthia.
From Phthia he fied to Iolcus, and Sophocles in his Peleus seems to have
represented him as driven thence when old and childish by the sons of Acastus
(Frag. 434-442 D), Euripides as banished by Acastus (Frag. 620-626 D).
But as Isocr. Evag. 192 b speaks of him as κατὰ, πολλοὺς ἄλλους κινδύνους
εὐδοκιμήσας, we cannot say what part 01 1115 1116 01 varied adventure was
especially in the mind of Horace. 97. proicit, ‘throws aside.’ ampullas:
cf. Ep. 1. 3. 14 11. sesquipedalia, polysyllables‚ such as those much in
favour with the early Latin dramatists. Gellius 19. 7 quotes from Laevius
foedtfrayw, pndoricolor, trisaecliseneae, dulcioritoqaus, and others, Pacuvius
