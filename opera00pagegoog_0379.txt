comparison with the description of the Raeti in line 18. prope qualis
. . . The construction is prope qualis Auster exercet undas . . . (tali modo)
inpiyer vemre turmas: ‘ almost as the South wind when he frets the waves

. (even so) unwearied to harass the squadrons of the foe and dash his
snorting steed . . . ' prope: the introduction of this word before
qualis is very remarkable. Metaphors, similes and the like are in their proper
place in Poetry, in Prose they are strictly speaking not· consequently P rose-
writers frequently introduce them with apologies and qualifications, Poets
rarely or never. A comparison in poetry that needs qualification or apology is
self- condemned. In S. 2. 3. 268 the purely conversational style admits prope.

21. Pleiadum . . . The Pleiades rise and set about the time of the equi-
noxes, and so of the equinoctial gales. They are spoken of as ‘cleaving the
clouds ' because, in the cloudy stormy weather which aceompanied their rising
and setting, they would be only seen fitfully through rents in the clouds.
24. medios per ignes : a proverbial phrase of facing any great danger, cf.
S. 2. 3. 56 ; Ep. 1. 1. 46, but specially of plunging into ‘the heat of the fray,'
cf. Sil. It. 14. 175 per medios iynes mediosque per ensem Ov. Met. 8. 76 ire
per iqnes Ι et gladios ausim. 25. tauriformis. The Greeks represented
rivers and torrents under the form of bulls, doubtless with reference to their
violence and their roar 3 so Homer, Il. 21. 237 describes Xanthus as μεμυκὼς
ἠύτε ταῦρος, and cf. Eur. Ion 1261 ὦ ταυρόμορφον ὄμμα Κηφισοῦ πατρός.
For the Aufidus cf. 3. 30. 10, 4. 9. 2. Horace with pardonable prejudice
selects the river of his native place. 28. meditatur, ‘ planS.’

29. agmina ferrata diruit, ⁶ dashed in pieces the mailed ranks.’ 31.
metendo, ‘ by mowing down.' So in English : ‘ Some men with swords may
reap the field, Ι And plant fresh laurels where they kill ’—J. Shirley. 32.
stravit humum, ‘ strewed the ground,' i.e. with the dead his swerd had
mowed down. sine clade victor: because of the small loss of his own men.
Of. Much Ado about Nothing 1. i. 8 ‘A victory is twice itself, when the
achiever brings home full numbers.’ 33. tuos divos. The expedition
was undertaken under the ‘ auspices ' of Augustus, see line 16 11. 34. quo
die, i.e. when Augustus after the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra at Actium
13.c. 31 passed on to the East and entered Alexandria some time in the autumn
of 13.e. 30. The words quo die are probably not to be taken too accurately.
36. vacuam: because Antony and Cleopatra had put an end to their lives.
See Shak. Ant. and Cleo. 1v. xv and Aet v.

37. lustro: 2. 4. 23 n. 40. arrogavit. This word usually means
(1) to adopt a child, (2) to appropriate to oneself what is not one’s own.
Neither sense suits here. Horace perhaps eoined the phrase on the analogy of
the well-known proroyare imperium. Just as the senate for a favourite or
victorious general (proroyabat imperium) ‘granted an extension (pro) of his

command,' so Fortune for her favourite Augustus ‘⁷ anted this additional (ad)

lo his ast ’ (decus peractis impertis arroyavth. 41.
Cantaber: . . n. 42. Medus, ‘the Parthiam' ef. 1. 2. 51 n. Indus,
Scythes. Suet. Oct. 21 says that embassies firom these two peoples came
to solieit the fiiendship of Augustus. 44. dominae, ‘ mistress‚' πλε. of
the world. 45. te . . . Hister. Wickham rightly points out that, though
the adjectival clause fontium qui celat oriyines applies primarily to the
Nile, yet ‘the position of the copulatives seems to show that the Danube is
included,’ cf. Seneca, Quaest. Nat. 4. 1, who compares the Danube with the
Nile, quod et fontes ignoti ec aestate quam hieme maior sit. 47. beluosus:
