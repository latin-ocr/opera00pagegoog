which were open in time of war and shut in time of peace. It was
said that, whereas they had only been twice closed previously, viz. in the
reign of Numa and after the first Punic war, they were closed three times in
the reign of AugustUS, viz. B.c. 29 and 24, and on one other occasion. Cf.
Suet. Oct. 22 Ianum Quirinum semel atque iterum a condita urbe clausum . . .
terra marique pace parta ter clausit. et ordinem . . . ‘ and curbed licence
that strayed outside the straight path.’ 10. frena inicere is found even
in prose=‘to curb,-’ or ‘restrain ’: on the other hand, dare frena: ‘to give
the rein to,’ ‘give full scope to.’ The metaphor in evaganti is from a horse
that in a race breaks away and leaves the rectus ordo or ‘ straight line ' of the
course: here however rectus ordo means also ‘the path of rectitude.' 12.
veteres arteS, ‘ancient arts‚’ ἰ’.ε. the virtues of old Roman life, such as
thrift, temperance‚ simplicity, on which Horace dwells in Book 3. 1-6 and
which Augustus attempted to galvanise into life again by numerous statutes.
For ars in this sense, cf. 3. 3. 9 hac arte Pollux.

14. imperi. For contracted gen. cf. 1. 6. 12 n. imperium, lit. ‘military
sway‚' then the ‘ state possessing military sway,’ ‘the Empire.’ 15.
maiestas. This word is technically used to describe the dignity (1) of the
gods, (2) of magistrates, and (3), most frequently, of the Roman State, ay.
in the phrase maiestas populi Romani: maiestatem p. R. minuere or laedere
is ‘to commit high treason‚' and ‘treason ' is laesa maiestas (cs. Norman-
French lese-maJeste). The phrase imperi maiestas represents the State as a
living unit, embodying and reproducing all the glories of Roman history, and,
as such, to be deemed reverend and inviolable. Cf. Cic. pro Rab. 1. 2 τηαίεε-
tacis atque imperi, = ⁶ the imperial dignity ' of Rome. 17. furor civilis,
‘ civil madness,' zze. civil war, such as had for a century devastated Italy, and·
made men indifferent to forms of government so long as they could en joy that
otium which was the greatest gift and greatest safeguard of the Empire. 18.
For exiget, ‘banish‚’ some MSS. read eximet, ‘take away! 20. inimicat ε a
word invented by Horace. inimicus is usually istinguished from hostis as a
private from a public enemy ; inimicus is one who might be a friend, hostis is
a stranger or foreigner : probably Horace therefore uses inimicat to bring out
more forcibly the idea that the strife between these ‘ hapless cities ' is not ‘a
war ’ but a ‘ family, domestic quarrel.’

21. qui profundum . . . πλε. dwellers by the Danube, cf. 2. 20. 20 n.
22. edicta Iulia, ‘the Julian decrees.' The word edictum is used loosely
here ε strictly it is the ‘ declaration ' made by the praetor on entering office of
the principles by which he would be guided in administering justice. See
Dict. Ant. επ. 23. Seres. Put for any remote Eastern nation‚ cf. 1. 12. 56.
infidi Persae, i.e. as always, the Parthians, cf. Ep. 2. 1. 112 invenior
Parthis mendacior, where the expression seems proverbial. ‘ Perfidy’ however
was a charge which the Romans commonly brought against successful op-

ponents, cf. 3. 5. 33 n. and 4. 4. 49.

we will enjoy it. et . . . et, ‘both . . δεξιᾶ] profestis: days which

the end of Horatius, ‘When the oldest cask is opened‚' etc. 29. virtute
functos duces: lit. ‘leaders who have fulfilled a man’s part‚' i.e. who have
died after pei-forming a man's part—⁶ the heroic dead.’ functus and defunctus
as expressing a completed task are continnally applied to the dead, as being
those who ‘rest from their labours‚' either with or without (though this is
