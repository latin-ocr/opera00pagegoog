13.c. 40, by Pacorus son of Orodes king of Parthia, and (2) to that of two
legions under Oppius Statianus 13.c. 36. See Mommsen in Orelli ⁴². 10.
non . . . inpetus, ‘have crushed our unblest assaults.' For the verb in
sing. cf. 2. 13. 38 11. non auspicatosz as the gods were neglected they
refused their favour to the arms of Rome, which are therefore spoken of as
‘ lacking good auspices.’ 11. adiecisse renidet: renidet takes an inf. from
the sense of ‘rej0icing ’ contained in it ; cf. line 21 doceri qaudet. It literally
means ‘beams back‚' and portrays the grin of satisfaction with which a savage

13. paene with delevit. seditionibus. See 3. 3. 29 n. The refer-
ence is to the civil wars, which since the days of Marius and Sylla had ‘ seized
on ' (cf. occupatam) Rome as their prey, but especially to the final struggle

’ between Octavian and Antony, which was concluded by the battle of Actium,
13.c. 31. 14. delevit urbem Dacus. N otice the effective juxtaposition
of urbem and Dacus. delevit is the strongest word Horace could have

troops who manned the fleet of Cleopatra. 17. fecunda. ‘ genera-
tions prolific in guilt first defiled wedlock and the family and homes: from
that source disaster' s growing flood o 'erspread our name and nation? cul-

inhabitants of Asia Minor. With the Greeks and Romans dancing was 311
accomplishment rarely practised except by slave girls who exhibited their
skill for 11110 31 banquets and the like. 22. artibus refers not merely
to dancing but to all the tricks and devices which women practise to
attract attention ; cf. Ov. Rem. Am. 691 artibus innumeris mens oppuynatu‘r
amantum. Many MSS. have artubus. 23. iam nuno, ‘even now,’ ie.
