boy is to be buried up to the chin and starved to death, a fourth witch, Folia,
being also present (41-46) : (47-82) Canidia prays the powers of evil to bring
Varus to her doors, and then breaks off (61) to ask why her spells avail not.
‘ Can some more skilful sorceress have prevailed over her? Never Ξ A still
more potent philtre shall fire his passion.' Then (83-102) 1118 boy, seeing
prayers are idle, breaks out into a curse and threatens them with the ven-
geance of his ghost. The scholiasts say that Canidia (17. 50 3 S. 1. 8. 24) was
really called Gratidia‚ and was an old flame of Horace’s. Such guesses seem
futile, and this Epode is only an immature attempt to depict 0118 of those soenes
of magio, which were popular with ancient readers 3 cf. Virgil's Pharmaoeutria‚
Ecl. 8, and its original in Tbeocr. 2. For the murder of the boy cf. the
well-known story of St. Hugh of Lincoln.

cupressos : Od. 2. 14. 23 n. 19. ‘and eggs besmeared with a foul toad's
blood and feathers of . . .' The eggs are those of the screech-owl, but the
position of ova next to ‘ranae is awkward. Shak'espeare puts in his witches'
