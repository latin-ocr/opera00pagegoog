was bound to protect. The Laws of the Twelve Tables say, Patronus si clienti
fraudem fecerit, sacer esto. cliens=‘one who listens ' or ‘obeys’3 cf.
κλύω. 26. salis avarus, ‘leap in the eagerness of greed.' salis indicates
his boldness and eagerness, cf. transiliunt 1. 3. 24. pellitur . . . natos.
The natural order of this sentence is considerably altered, 011 purpose to get
the emphatic verb pellitur first, ‘forth is driven . . .' For the whole scene,
cf. Guy Mannering, c. 8, and Meg Merrilies' curse on Ellangowan.

29. nulla certior tamen, ‘ and yet no han awaits its wealthy lord more
surely than the appointed end of greedy Death‚' i.e. more certainly than the
hall you are building does the grave, the appointed end of all men, await you,
So Nauck rightly, and finis Orci is simply the common Gk. phrase τέλος
θανάτοιο. All editors however agree in saying that fine and destinata though
side by side do not go together, and Kiessling, for example, explains ‘ no hall
more certainly awaits its lord than the hall destined for you (aula destinata)
by the end of ravening Orcus, i.e. by the end which Orcus (personified) has
appointed for you.' But that in three consecutive words fine destinata aula,
the abl. fine is to be separated from the abl. destinata, and made dependent
on it (an abl. case being thus forcibly thrust in between certior and its own
abl. which ought to follow it closely), and that before aula in the nom. aula
in the abl. is to be supplied, seems impossible.

34. regum. Either actual ‘kings,’ or, as often, ‘great men.’ satelles
Orci: no doubt Horace is thinking of Charon, but the peculiar form of the
expression ‘ attendant ' or rather ‘sentinel of Orcus ' is to be noticed. The
palace (aula) which the rich man is preparing is compared with the place

Both Orelli and Wickham say ‘not Charon but Orcus‚' for, they urge, the
next lines, and especially the word vocatus, cannot refer to Charon. But (1)
to make hic not refer to the main nom. of the preceding sentence, but to a
merely qualitative word such as Orci, especially when the last words of the
sentence are auro captus in agreement with satelles, is to violate the first
principles of speech. If a schoolboy were to say, ‘The Head-master’s butler
wouldn’t let me out though well tipped. He is a beast,' according to this
theory ‘He ’ would-:the Head-master. (2) Those who say that line 40 could
not be used of Charon forget that Horace, though no doubt thinking of
Charon, has only spoken of satelles Orci, and surely it is the part of a satelles
when summoned (vocatus) to hearken (audire, ὑπακούειν). Cf. too coercet

ay and unsummoned—to relieve the poor man whose toils are over, obeys.'
