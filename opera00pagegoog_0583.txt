BOOK ΙΙ

EPISTLE Ι

Suetonius (vit. Horat.) tells us that Augustus entertained such a high opinion
of Horace's work that he urged him to write the Fourth Book of the Odes
(see Intr. to Book IV) and also post sermones quosdam lectos complained that
there was no mention made of himself, saying to the poet ‘irasci me tibi scito,
quod non in plenisque eiusmodi scriptis mecum potissimum loquaris. an
vereris, ne apud posteros infame tibi sit, quod videa'ris familiaris nobis esse 2 ²
In this way expressit eoloyam ad se cuius initium est .· cum tot sustinect-5, etc.
'Phe date of the Epistle may therefore be fairly assigned to 13 13.c.‚ when
Augustus returned to Rome after an absence of three years in Gaul. The phrase
semones quidam can hardly apply to the Satires, which had been published
many years previously, but may refer to the first Book of the Epistles, οι· to
the second and third Epistles of this Book, which were probably written before
the first.

This Epistle has always been a favourite one. It contains much shrewd
criticism, with some of those happy autobiographical touches which Horace
knew so well how to throw in. Mommsen calls these three Epistles ‘the most
graceful and delightful works in all Roman literature.'

1-4. With. all the daim upon your time, Caesar, I should be mapale-ione,
if Ι were to adde-ess you at Zenyth. 1. solus: Augustus did not lose the
support of Agrippa until 12 B.c., but since 17 B.c. he had been in the East,
returning to Rome this year, about the same time as Augustus returned from
Gaul. But Horace is speaking of the responsibility of empire; and with a
natural license. 2. moribus: the position which Augustus assumed as a
‘ saviour of society ' and reformer of morals is often dwelt upon by the poets
of his time. For loyes see Od. 3. 6 Intr. 4. morer tua tempora, ‘waste
your time'3 cf. 1. 13. 17 oculos auresque morari, ‘to make eyes and ears
dwell upon a thing.' The time which Augustus had at his command sor
important business, is represented as in danger of being taken up with Horace’s
poetry. The plural tempora in prose always seems to carry with it something
of the force of καιροί ‘ opportunities ' for doing anything, not merely the lapse
of time : thus often: ‘crisis,' ‘emergencies.’

5-17. 17ae nwst illustr-ioue heroes have not found recoynition, while on earth,

Romulus . . . ε cf. Od. 3. 3. 9 seq. 6. deorum in templa: cf. Ennius in
Varro de L. L. 7. 6 unus erit quem tu tolles in caerula caeli Ι templa. The
phase may merely: ‘heavem' templum being used in its augural sense of a
‘quarter ’ of the sky, or we may explain ⁶ admitted to share the worship
of the gods ' in earthly temples. 7. colunt, connected by a sort of zeugma
with terras and genus. With the former it would more naturally mean
‘ dwell on‚' but from its connexion with the latter it acquires a kind of re-
flectdd force of ‘caring for.' Cf. Virg. Ecl. 3. 60 ab Iove principium . . . ille
colit berra-3. 8. agros adsignant, i.e. institute property in land ; S. 1. 3.
