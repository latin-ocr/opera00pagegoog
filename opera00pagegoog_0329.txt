methods of commencing a narrative are avoided by this sudden exclamation of
abhorrence. For nam see line 1 n. potuere . . . potuere. potuere
in line 30 has its simple sense=‘ had power,' but in line 31 a somewhat rarer
one: ‘ had the heart to ' (cf. Epod. 9. 14). Translate ‘ Impious—for what were
they able more? yes impious they were able to slay.' 31. duro: partly
literal, ‘harcL' partly metaphorical‚ ‘unrelenting' 3 νηλέϊ χαλκῷ. Cf. line 45.

home on the eve of the wedding·day by torchlight. 34. periurum ε because
he had solemnly betrothed his daughters to the sons of Aegyptus, 35.
splendide mendax. Probably the best known instance in Latin of Oxy-
moron (ὀξύμωρον, ‘pointedly-foolish ')‚ the favourite rhetorical figure by
which words of apparently opposite force are brought together. Cf. Soph.
Ant. 74 ὅσια, πανουργήσασα ‘having wrought a holy crime ' (said by Antigone
of herself), and Tennyson (of Lancelot): ‘ His honour rooted in dishonour
stood, Ι And saith unsaithsul kept him falsely true? So too Lucan 1. 95
concordia discors. Other instances in the Odes are 1. 27. 11 beatus vulnere,
1. 33. 2 inmitis Glycerae, 1. 34. 2 insanientis sapientiae, 2. 8. 1 iuris perierem,
3. 4. 5 amabilis insania, 3. 5. 48 eyreyz'us exsul, 3. 21. 13 lene tomentum.

40. salle, ‘ cheat‚' zie. by escaping. 41. quae . . . lacerant, ‘who like
she-lions that have pounced upon bullocks are, Ο horror, rending each her
victim.' Note the inimitable brevity and clearness of the Latin. 42. ego

45. me . . . me. Note the emphasis: ‘you shall not be the victime no,
on me, even me let vengeance fall? 47. me vel . . . ‘me let him banish

ODE XII

A soliloquy in which Neobule (Νεοβούλη ‘one with new ideas')‚ a dis·
