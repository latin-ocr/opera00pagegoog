SATIRES.—BOOK Ι

SATIRE 1

SUBJECT 2—le Restlcss Discontcnt of Men, especially of the avarus.
DA'rE 2—about 35 B.c.

THIS Satire, although placed at the beginning, was probably the last composed
Α of those in the first book. Horace here prefixes to the first book a poem of
general bearing on all sorts and conditions of men, just as he does in the first
Ode of the first book. Like it, and like the first Epode and first Epistle, it
is addressed to his patron and friend Maecenas.

The avowed subject of the Satire is the discontent of men with their lot,
and their envy of that of others, 1-19. But this theme is only prefatory to
an attack on avarice : this is the real subJ'ect, 28 seq. , the avarus being selected
as the most striking instance of the discontented man. There are in reality
two subjects, discontent and avarice, but Horace tries to treat them as one,
and the suture is apparent. The different individuals who, discontented with
their lot, are struggling to attain a competence, are regarded as so many
phases of the avarae, 28-40. Hence discontent ceases to be the salient feature
of attack, and the grasping·and meanness of the avarus are satirised on to 108,
when Horace, feeling that he has strayed from his original theme, suddenly
reverts to it, and cleverly interlaces his two subJ'ects together. For his theme,
and to a great extent his treatment of it, he seems indebted to Lucilius.

2. ratio, deliberate choice, προαίρεσις : fors, accident, often opp. to ratio τ
‘choice or chauces cf. Cic. ad Att. 14. 13. 3 sed haecfors viderit, ea, quae talibus
in ‘rebus plus quam ratio potest. obiecerit, ‘has flung in his way ' : cf. 1.
6. 54; Cic. ad Att. 2. 22. 1 quodsors obtulerit, id facturus videtur. 3. laudet:
quisque is to be taken out of the preceding nemo, and sed is also to be supplied :
cf. line 109 3 Juv. 6. 17 cum furem nemo timeret Ι caulibus et pomis ct aperto
viveret horto ,· Cic. de Or. 3. 14. 52 nemo extulit eum verbis . . . sed contempsit
eum; Plat. Rep. 366 D οὐδεὶς ἑκὼν δίκαιος, ἀλλ’ ὑπὸ ἀνανδρίας . .. . ψέγει
τὸ ἀδικεῖν.

4. gravis annis: cf. Virg. Aen. 9. 246 hic annis yravis atque animi
maturus Aletes ; Theocr. 24. 101 πολλοῖσι βαρύς περ ἐὼν ἐνιαυτοῖς : Soph. Oed.
R. 17 σὺν γήρᾳ βαρεῖς. The phrase does not mean that the man is weighed
down by years, but that he goes heavily, has lost his nimbleness owing to
yearS‚ is getting stiff. A man becomes stiff before the age at which a Roman
soldier got his discharge, about 45. 5. iam fractus, ‘ at length broken
down! iam is often joined with participles and adJ'ectives‚ and, like ἤδη.
denotes that a certain point has at last been reached. J uv. 3. 206 iamque.
vetus Graecos servabat cista libellos ,· Ov. Her. 13. 98 iamque fatigyatas ultima
verset aquas. fractus membra, ‘having his limbs broken down ' ; cf. od.
1. 1. 21 membra stratus. Some call it acc. of reference ‘broken down in his
limbs‚' but more probably the part. has a certain middle force.
