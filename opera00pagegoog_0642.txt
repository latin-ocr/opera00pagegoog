614 HORACE ARs

309. Here begins the third main division of the poem, and the rest of it is
but an expansion of the ideas of lines 307, 308.

309-322 (unde parentur opes). The first requisite for writiny is sound
judqment and wide knowledye of human character, which can best be qained by
α study of philosophy: and this wilt win favour for α play. 309. recte
sapere, ‘ a sound Judgment and correct knowledge ' of the matter to be dealt
with. 310. rem, i.e. especially the facts of human nature and character.
Socraticae chartae, i.e. the writings of the followers of Socrates. Besides
Plato and Xenophon, Horace probably was thinking also of the writings of
Aeschines and perhaps Antisthenes ε whether he included the later Academics
and Stoics is very doubtful. 311. verbaque . . . sequentur: cf. Cic.
de Orat. 3. 31. 125 rerum enim copia verborum copiam 9iqnit; Cato's rule rem
tene, verba sequentur ,· and the saying of Asinius Pollio, mate hercle eveniat
verbis nisi rem sequantur. 312. quid. debeat, ‘ his duties towards ’ etc„
not, of course, with any special reference to himself, but generally what duties
are owed by men. . 314. conscripti, ‘a senator': the word used alone in
this sense only occurs here. For the origin of the phrase patres conscripti,

see WilkinS. iudicis: cf. S. 1. 4. 123 n. 315. partes: Ep. 2. 1. 171.

318. doctum, picking up qui didicit 312 3 after learning all that can be
learned from books then study nature. vivas voces, ‘language faithful
to life': cf. Plat. Phaedr. 276 A λόγον ζῶντα καὶ ἔμψυχον, οὗ ὁγεγραμμένος
εἴδωλον ἄν τι λέγοιτο δικαίως. 319. interdum . . . ‘sometimes a play
with brilliant passages and correct drawing of character, though it has no grace
(cf. 1. 6. 38) from its lack of weighty and artistic language‚ gives more pleasure to
the people, and keeps their attention better than lines wanting in matter and
melodious trifles.’ For speciosa locis cf. Quint. 7. 1. 41 plerique . . . con-
tenti sunt locis speciosis modo vel nihil ad probationem conserentibus. Others
take loci of the loci communes of rhetoric, ie. general remarks on subjects such
as piety‚ friendship‚ justice etc„ which the orator has ready to hand so that
he can apply them to any particular case (cf. Quint. 5. 10. 20 Zoci . . . sedes
aryumentorum in quibus latent, esc quibus sunt petenda). But a writer who
had the technical skill to use these could hardly be said to be sine arte, and
what Horace points out is that brilliant passages and characters that ‘talk
like life ’ are often more effective than great technical skill in producing lines
with no stuff in them though exquisite in sound.

323. ore rotundo, the στόμα στρογγύλον of the Greeks, denoted a smooth,
easy style of utterance, so that Dionys. Hal. de vi Demosth. 19 uses στρογγύλη
λέξις as opposed to μακρά and πλατεῖα of ‘ well—rounded ’ periods, and
ascribes to Lysias (Jud. LyS. 6) ὴ συστρέφουσα τὰ νοήματα καὶ στρογγύλως
ἐκφέρουσα λέξις. Τ110 style of Lysias is nearly the exact opposite of what
some people mean when they talk of speaking ore rotundo. Conington's
‘ready wit and rounded phrase ' will d0. 326. in partes centum: the
language is here not intended to be exact ; the duodecimal, not the decimal
method of subdivision was always used at Rome. The as was divided into 12
unciae, the uncia again into 4 sicilici, or 24 scriptula or scripula5 sometimes
even the scripulum was divided into 2 simplici, each ἷξε of an as. dicat:
cf. Od. 1. 27. 10 dicat Opuntiae frater Mcyittcte. Albinus is unknown.
327. quincunce : cf. Roby 447 seq., S. G. 189. 328. superat : so most
MSS.; one or two have superest, but supero not supersum seems to be the
technical word in such a case. poteras: so most Mss; a few have
poterat. The past impf. is best explained as an expression of some slight im·
