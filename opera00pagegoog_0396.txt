rage,' i.e. by breaking the oath sworn by them. 4. in Verba iurabas ε cf.
16. 25 3 Ep. 1. 1. 14 iurare in verba mayisiri ,· the phrase describes swearing
io a form of words recited by another3 so especially of soldiers taking the
oath of allegiance to their commander, e.g. in verba P. Scipionis iurare. 5.
artius atque, ‘ more closely than.' This use of atque is a poetic extension of
its use in comparisons (after aequus, similis, iolem etc.) to put two things
closely side by side3 of. Virg. Aen. 3. 561 haud. minus ae iussi faciunt.
hedera: cf. Od. 1. 36. 20. 6. lentis, ‘pliant, ‘clingingl

as long as the order of nature remained unchanged. 9. intonsos ε Od. 1.
21. 2 n. 10. mutuum: Od. 4. 1. 30 11. For turbaret, agitaret, Bentley,
with some authority, read turbarit agyitarit, which Nauck prefers as more
dramatie—‘ (you swore, saying) that while the wolf shall 116 . . . 11116 love

shall be' 3 cf. renarint 16. 25, following iuremus in haee. 11. Virtute,
‘manhood’ (13.6. 1660101100); cf. viri in next line. The abl. is that of the

forma offensa, ‘beauty that has become hateful,’ meant ⁴ beauty that has become
ugly'! But Horace never dreams of Neaera as ugly. No: it is her very

galling doubts of jealousy become certainties (cf. certus). 17. meo . . .
‘ who now march triumphant in my mishap ' (lit. ‘ rendered proud by ') ε
incedis suggests the haughty gait of a victor ; cf. Virg. Aen. 5. 68, who also

22. Nirea: Od. 3. 20. 15 n. 23. eheu. Horace mimics his rival's cry.
