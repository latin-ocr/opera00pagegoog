Nine was the regular number for a triclinium: three on each couch, though
the number was often exceeded‚ 1. 4. 86. Varro, ap. Gell. 13. 11, says the
number of the diners ought to begin with that of the Graces, three, and not
exceed that of the MuseS‚ nine. The lowest couch was generally reserved for

private secretary ab ista parasitica mensa. 23. Nomentanus is not
necessarily the prodigal of 1. 1. 102; 2. 3. 224, but probably a man of that
character, a ruined spendthrift. It was bad teste in Nasidienus to ask such a
man to meet Maecenas, but his circle was not a fashionable one. ipsum,
