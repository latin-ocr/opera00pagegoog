bargain (locabat) with the vespillones or sandapilarii to carry the body 10 1116
wretched graveyard in a cheap shell (arca, or, as elsewhere, sandapila).
Orelli* quotes an inscription which shows that slaves had burial-societies.
10. stabat, ‘ was fixed by fate‚' seems to be the meaning. commune
sepulchrum : a reminiscence of Lucr. 5. 259 omniparens eadem rerum com-
mane sepulchrum. 11. Pantolabus (επαντολάβος) 13 said by Porph. to
have been a nickname for one Mallius Verna, from his habit of borrowing
sums of money from his friends, when reduced to penury. This line is nearly
repeated 2. 1. 22. Observe the power with which Horace briefiy notices the
fact, that a slave's burial is the destined end of the rake and spendthrift. -
13. hic, ‘heress cippus, a pillar‚ with an inscription on it (6.9. ΙΝ - AG ·
P · XII · ΙΝ · ΡΒ · Ρ · xxiv ·-—Corp. Ins. 4374) stating the limits of the ceme-
tery, which were a frontage (in fronte) of 1000 feet, a depth (in ayru‘m) of 300.
heredes monumentum ne sequeretur, ‘ (with an injunction) that the
monument was not to descend to the heirs.' It was customary to inscribe on
monuments of the dead the letters Η · Μ · Η · N · s ·‚ i.e. hoc monumentum
heredes non sequitur, or Η · Μ - AD H · Ν - TRANs · (ne transito). Horace dwells
with humorous pathos on the amplitude of the poor man's 1·esting-place‚
and represents special pains being taken to prevent 113, 311611311011 should his
heirs part with the rest of his property.

14. nunc licet Esquiliis. Maecenas somehow or other came into posses-
sion of this burial-ground and other waste land lying on the Esquiline outside
the walls. He cleared the spot, beautified and improved it, and built there a
handsome mansion, which men called tam-is Maecenatiana (od. 3. 29. 10 11.).
salubribus: before this time, owing to bad drainage and malaria from the
cemetery‚ the Esquiline was unhealthy. 15. aggere; the agger of Servius
Tullius, who included the Esquiline and Viminal in the city, heightened by
Tarquinius Superbus: it ran from the Esquiline Gate to the Colline Gate.
quo = in qao and so ‘ where,' the preposition not being repeated after in aprico.
So most, but Palmer accepts Peerlkamp's qui. · 16. Note the spondees.
17. cum refers back to nunc line 14. suetae: cf. Lucr. 1. 60‘appellare
sueonu3‚· 2. 903 sentire sueti. 19. carminibus . . . atque veneniS,
‘spells and potions! versant, ‘practise on.' 21. vaga: so Virg. Aen.
1. 742 hic canit errantem lunam .· ‘the moving moon went up the sky,' Cole-
ridge. 22. protulit os: Virg. Aen. 8. 589 qualis ubi Oceani perfusus
‚Istam-’fer unda. . . extulit 03 sacram caelo,· G. 4. 232 Tayyete simul οε tems
ostendit honestum. legant: leqere is properly used both with ossa and
herbas: it is the regular word for gathering bones from the ashes of the
funeral pyre: cf. Propert. 2. 24. 50 vix venit eor-tremo qui legat ossa die.

23. vidi egomet . . . As remarked by Comm. Cruq., these lines habent
aliquid trayieae desm‘ptioni3; cf. Virg. Aen. 3. 623 vidi eyomet dno . . .
succinctam, ‘with her robe tucked up ² : cf. Epod. 5. 25 ; Ovid, Met. 7. 182
of Medea, the arch-witch amdam tedis vestes induta ‘recincta-3, Ι ‘nuda pedem,
nudos umeris infusa capillos. 24. Canidiam: see Epod. 5 Intr. 25.
Sagana mentioned also Epod. 5. 25 33 311 accomplice of Canidia. Probably
the word is a pseudonym invented by Horace, and connected by him with
saga, ‘ a witch‚' in spite of the difference in quantity, and so too Canidia a
canitie. maiore: either ‘ the elder ’ (she had a younger sister according to
Comm. Cruq.)‚ or ‘more powerful’ than Canidia herself, or ‘taller' than Canidia.
ululantem, ‘ whooping her witch-chant.' ululatus is nearly always of
16313163, and often used of chants in sacred rites ; so Medea Ov. Met. 7. 190
