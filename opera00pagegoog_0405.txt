Troy,' Wickham.

Ant. s.v. Fasces, and cf. Od. 3. 2. 19. 55 . Scythae, Indi. For their em-

memory of the battle of Actium, cf. Od. 1. 31. 1. Many MSS. have ara&
aequus, ‘ with favourable eye.’ 66. felix. The run of the verse points to
this word going with Latium rather than lustrum, as Orelli takes it. 67. lus-
trum: cf. od. 2. 4. 23 n. Τ116 reference is doubtless to the fact that Augustus,
at the conclusion of the 10 years for which he originally accepted the imperium,
was in Rc. 18 invested with it for a further period of five years, 68. pro-
rogat, curat, applicat : prwoqet has good MS. authority, but curet, applicet,
