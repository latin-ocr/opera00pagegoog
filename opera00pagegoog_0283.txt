that! pubes crescit, servitus crescit. Horace by simply putting
these two statements side by side expresses the completeness of Barine’s em-
pire ε to say ‘ new youths are growing up ' is identical with saying ‘ you have
new slaves growing up‚' the two phrases are interchangeable. 21. te . . .
Barine was the dread of three classes—timid mothers, thrifty fathers, and
anxious brides. iuvencis: see 2. 5. 1 n. It is used here satirically for
some such word as ‘darling.' 23. tua aura, ‘the breath of your love!

ODE IX

‘ Raiu, stom, frost do ‘not last for ever, bat your 9rief, Valyius‚ for M ystes
seems eternal. And yet even Nestor cea-sect to tament his sou, nor did his
sister-s bewail Troilus for ever. Cease theu these womardy tears, and Zet us
find retieffor private sorrow-s iu sinqiuy os the yterious exploits of Auqustus.'

When Augustus was in Spain B.0. 27-25 he received a deputation from the
Scythians (cf. Gelonos line 23) offer-ing submission, and in 23 he received similar
deputations from the Parthians at Rome. Hence most fix the date of this
Ode between 27 and 23 B.c. The definite language, however, of 18 seq. about
the ⁴ recent trophies ’ secured from the conquest of Armenia and Parthia points
to a later date, for Augustus went to the East B.o. 21, and in B.0. 20 sent an
expedition into Armenia under Tiberius and recovered from the Parthians the
standards lost by Crassus at Carrhae, receiving the personal submission of
Prahates (cf. Ep. 1. 12. 26). Horace when he wrote the last two stanzas
seems to have had in mind VirgiL G. 3. 30 addam urbes Asiae domitas
pulsumque Niphaten Ι fidentemque fuya Parthum versisque sayittis‘, Ι et duo
rapta manu diverso ex hoste tropaea, and, although the date of the Georgics
is nc. 37-30, these lines are generally considered an addition made by Virgil
shortly before his death in B.c. 19. For Valgius cf. S. 1. 10. 82 n.

1. hispidos, ‘shaggy‚’ te. ‘rough,’ ‘ disordered‚' representing the effect of
continuous wet weather on the fields. 2. caspium, ArmeniiS‚ Gargani.
Of. 1. 1. 13 n. 3. inaequales: either ‘unevem’ ‘gusty,' or ‘that make
uneven ² (cf. hispidos), the latter sense being supported by the application of
the adj. to a bad haireutter, Ep. 1. 1. 94.

5. stat, ‘is stiff‚’ referring to the rigidity of ice3 cf. 1. 9. 3. iners,
‘liseless.' So 4. 7. 12 bruma recurrit iners. The epithet partly refers to the
torpor which is always associated with extreme cold, and partly to the fact
that frost stops all outdoor work. Of. too 1. 22. 17 piyris campis of the
Arctic regions. 7. laborant, ⁴ strain beneath the N. wiuds,⁷ The timber
groans and ereaks as if in pain. cf. 1. 9. 3 silvae laborantes, of snow-laden
branches. Garganus is amountain in Apulia. 8. viduantur, ‘ are widowed
of,' ele. ‘ are despoiled of.' N otice how throughout these two stanzas Horace
selects illustrations from nature which admirably fall in with the idea of grief,
‘raim’ ‘ disorder‚’ ⁴ storms,' ‘liselessnesffi’ ‘winds‚’ ‘ groans, ‘ desolation.'

9. tu, ‘but you.' The adversative force is brought out by the prominent
position of tu. urgues flebilibus modis, ‘ pursue unweariedly with
mournful mensures! urguere is a favourite word with Horace 3· cf. 2. 10. 2 ;
18. 20. It here indicates that Valgius will not let the subJect of Mystes'
loss go ; he is ‘continually pursuing’ it. 10. Mysten: from μύστηςε
initiated. Probably he was a favourite Greek slave (such as the auaqnostes
or reader, whom Cicero laments, ad Att. 1. 12); the name is found in
inscriptions applied to slaves. Vespero: from Vefferus the evening star
