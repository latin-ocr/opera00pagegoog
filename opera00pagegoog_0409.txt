phatic or demonstrative like illum praeteritum, line 115, for illis quaesitis is
not Latin for illis quae quaesiverit. utitur, emphatically ‘enjoys,' ‘con-
sumes ' 3 cf. Ep. 1. 7. 57 et quaerere et uti, where there is the same contrast
between quaerere and uti as here 3 A. Ρ. 170 quaerit et inventis miser abstinet
ac timet uti. 38. sapiens, ‘sensible‚’ i.e. knowing how to enjoy the good
things of life, not ⁶ prudent,' nor a translation of ἴδρις applied to the ant, Hes.
Works and Days 778. For this use of sapiens cf. Od. 1. 11. 6 sapias, vina
lique&- Od. 1. 7. 17 ; 4. 9. 48; Ep. 1. 15. 45; Ov. Her. 4. 96. The reading
patiens of many MSS. would do very well as a general epithet of the ant, and
especially well if the point were that she patiently endures, roughing it, until
spring3 but that is not the point: the point is that the ant, like a sensible
creature, makes merry while winter rages, thereby contrasting with the
avarus, who might be called patiens rather than the ant.

milia dum centum ⁸frumenti tolti' medimnum. triverit ε for the construc-
tion cf. 1. 3. 15 n. 3 1. 10. 64; 2. 6. 48. tero is regular for threshing corn,
ἀλοιάω, and area is an open solid level place, a threshing-fioor, ἀλωή.
46. hoc, ‘ on this account,' especially used with comparatives3 cf. 1. 3. 93
minus hoc iucundus amicus, capiet, ‘hold‚' χωρήσει. plus aczptus
quanm cf. 1. 2. 22; 1. 6. 130; 1. 10. 34. ut si . . . ‘just as, if you
were a slave carrying the breed-bag, you would get no more bread than the
other slaveS.' In 1. 5. 90 the traveller carries the excellent bread umeri& i.e.
on the shoulders of his slaves. 47. reticulum was a Q used
for carrying loaves on a journey 3 Juv. 12. 60 eum reticulis et pane et ventre

49. quid. referat . . . viventi. 'l'here is no other certain instance of
refert with dat. of a person. It may be explained as substituted for the
usage ad with acc„ which is common in early Latin3 e. 9. Plaut. Pers. 4. 3.
52 quid id ad me aut ad meam rem refert. 52. tantundem haurire,
‘to draw as much as you.’ haurire is properly used of drawing liquids‚ and
it is strange that Horace did not choose some other verb when about to pro-
pound a metaphor taken from the storing of corn z perhaps the next metaphor
from drinking was in his mind. relinquas, with inf„ ‘allow,' ‘concede,'
a poetic usage : see Lucr. 3. 40, and Munro's note. 53. plus laudes. Cf.
Ep. 1. 10. 15 plus tepeant hiemes. Similarly Horace is fond of the adverbia]
use of muttum3 cf. 2. 3. 147 11. cumeris, corn-bins (κυψέλη), probably
made of osiers: see Ep. 1. 7. 30. Acron mentions another kind, fictitia vasa.

54. ut . . . si, ‘just as if you needed only a pitcher of water and were
to say.' Notice the difference between the construction here and the appar-
ently, but not really, similar one in 46-48. liquidi, ‘water'3 cf. Ov.
