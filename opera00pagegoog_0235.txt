is in agreement with the nom. to conamur, and qrandia in apposition
with the accusatives stomachum, cursus, and domum, but it needs a

13. tunica tectum adamantina: the Homeric χαλκεοθώραξ and

by the prominent position of the pronoun, which at once contrasts Horace

fiercely attacking youths (acrium in iuvenes) with trimmed nails ’ ; the nails
are ‘ trimmed’ as those of any fashionable beauty would be (the opp. of
Canidia's inresectum pollicem Epod. 5. 47), though of course the adj. suggests
that they would not do much harm. 19. vacui, i.e. sive vacui, cf. 1.

ODE VII

‘ Many fair ancl favour-ite places are there on earth, none thal I love so
fondly as Tibur. Do you, Plancus, whether as now in camp or, as you will be
soon, I trust, al Tibur, remember that it is occasionally true philosophy to

invitation, cf. 1. 20. 1) in striking contrast to tenent in line 20, Horace really
addresses an invitation to Plancus to come to Tibur.

l. laudabunt. Cf. 1. 6. 1: = ‘ others shall praise ' (for all Ι care), i.e. let
others praise. 2. bimaris. The two harbours of Corinth are Cenchreae
on the Saronic Gulf and Lechaeum on the Corinthian Gulf. 4. Tempe:

5. sunt quibus . . . ‘some there are whose sole task it is to cele-
brate in continuone song the city of the ever-virgin Pallas, and to place
upon their brow an olive-wreath plucked from every side.' sunt
