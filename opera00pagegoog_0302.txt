This Ode is usually accounted a mere imitation of a Gk. dithyramb, but
it seems rather the expression of the poet’ 6 longing m a period of anarchy and
discord for an ideal and idyllic world : this he symbolises under the form of
a vision of the reign of Bacchus, the giver of happiness and abundance‚ the
founder of civilisation, and the conqueror of the rebel powers of darkness.
