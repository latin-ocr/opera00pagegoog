602 HORACE Ans

Agesilaus who was of small stature, by quoting ὤδινεν ὅρος, Ζεὺς δ’ ἐφοβεῖτο,
τὸ δ’ ἔτεκεν μῦν. For the rhythm cf. Virg. G. 1. 181.

141. dic . . . urbes. Horace gives a compressed rendering of the first
three lines of the Odyssey (cf. Ep. 1. 2. 19), clearly, however, reading νόμον
(mores) in line 3: ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, Μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ Ι
πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσε, Ι πολλῶν δ’ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν
ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω. tempora: cf. Od. 1. 28. 11 Troiana tempora, Ov.
Met. 11. 757 novissima Troiae tempora. Bentley (and so Kiessling) read
moenia. 144. cogitat, ‘his plan is ἐ speciosa miracula, ‘ striking
marvels.' 145. Antiphaten, king of the Laestrygonian cannibals Od.
10. 100 seq. For Scylla and Charybdis cf. Od. 12. 87 seq. and for the Cyclops
whom Odysseus encountera od. 9. 160 seq. 146. reditum . . . orditur,
a compressed expression for ‘nor does he act like the writer who began ' etc.
Homer of course himself says nothing about the return of Diomede. The
scholiasts say that Antimachus, in relating the return of Diomede, began with
the history of Meleager, the brother of his' father Tydeus, and filled twenty-
four books before he even got as far as the campaign of the Seven against
Thebes, in which Tydeus fell. But as the Thebais of Antimachus—a poem,
which though not generally popular, won for its writer in the judgment of
some critics a place next to Homer (cf. Quintil. 10. 1. 53)·-6611 barely have
touched upon the return of Diomede from the Trojan War, there is probably
some error in the tradition.

147. gemino . . . ab ovo, πλε. from the birth of Helen. Servius on
Virg. 3. 338 says Ledam Iuppiter iu cyyuum ‘mutatus yraviclam fecit, quae
ovum peperisse dicitur, uncle uati suut Helena, Caelosel Pollux. Horace
here follows another form of the story, according to which Castor and Pollux
were born from one egg (cf. S. 2. 1. 26 ovo proyuatus eodem), Helen from
another. 148. ad. eventum festinat, ‘goes straight on to the crisis ' with-
out undue digressions, or losing the thread of his arrative. in medias
res: as in Hom. Od. 1. 11 ἔνθ’ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες, ὅσοι φύγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον

Ι οἴκοι ἕσαν κτλ. So the Iliad begins with a scene in the tenth year of the
siege ; and Virgil plunges into the midst of his narrative (Aen. 1. 34) with the
words vix e conspectu Siculae telluris iu altum Ι vela dabant laeli etc. Of.
Cic. ad Att. 1. 16. 1 respondebo tibi ὕστερον πρότερον, Ὁμηρικῶς, Quint. 7.
10. 11 ubi ab init-iis iuceffleudum, ubi rmore Homerico e mediis vel ultimis?
151. mentitur, ‘uses fiction’: cf. Aristot. Poet. 24. 18 δεδίδαχε δὲ μάλιστα
’Όμηρος καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ψευδῆ λέγειν ὡς δεῖ. ita . . . ne: cf. Ep. 1.
13. 12. 152. discrepet: cf. Cic. de Fin. 5. 28. 83 ‘respondent extrema
primis, media utrisque, omnia munibus.

153-178. T Ize characters os the drama are to be hamlled iu accordauce with
the leudeneies of their several times os life. 154. plausoris, zze. spectators
who will applaud all through until the final vos plaudite. Bentley objects to
the word followed by plaudite in the next line and reads fautoris, but cf.
S. 1. 3. 1 cantaris followed by cantare. aulaea: cf. Ep. 2. 1. 189 n.
155. cantor. The word is ambiguous3 for cauere is used both of playing
on the flute, and of singing with the voice. Bentley assumed that the cautor
was the flute-player‚ and wrote ‘ cantoris erat depositis ex ore tibiis plaudite
insonare! Hermann on the other hand (Opusc. 1. 302) argues that the cautor
and the histrio were one. Wilkins takes it of the ‘singer’ who sang the esnatica
(lyric monologues) ; cf. Livy 7. 2, who tells us that Livius Andronicus, having
been encored in these until he lost his voice, introduced the practice of having a
