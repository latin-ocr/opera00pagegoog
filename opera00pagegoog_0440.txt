‘ up to the middle.' 28. pectore, ‘on (or down) his breast.' The stripe
(in the tunic) began at the neck.

31. et cupiat: el as well as the other reading, ut, explains morbus, et,
however, has a great preponderance of MS. authority. 34. promittit:
Orelli takes this to refer to the promises of a candidate for office. It more
likely refers to the form of oath taken by elected magistrates. 35? im-
perium, ‘the empire ' externa] to Italy ; properly, the sway held by Rome

38. Syrus, Dama, Dionysius are names of slaves taken at haphazard.
Dama is a Latinised form of Δημᾶς, which is a shortened form of Δημόδωρος :

acting with great severity. Cadmo: Cadmus is supposed to have been
the name of a public executioner 3 Porph. says z Cadmus carmffeoe illo tempore

knights were entitled to the sront fourteen rows next to the. orchestra, which

pareret. The subjunctive assigns the reason, from the point of view of those

who ran Horace down. convictor (vivo) implies close familiarity; one η ,

who is admitted within the inner circle of domestic life. Ov. Ep. 4. 3. 15 ille
