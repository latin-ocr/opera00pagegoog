an invited guest of distinction, as Maecenas brought Vibidius and Balatro to
the dinner given by Nasidienus (S. 2. 8. 22). 29. premunt, ‘annoy.’

A. A. 3. 193 ε 1110 feminine form only here. 30. quotus esse velie, ‘how
large you would like the party to be‚' ‘name your number ’ : cf. Mart. 14. 217
dic quotus et quanli cupias cenare. quotus asks a question, the answer to
which is to be given by an ordinal: hence we may compare the Gk. phrase
ᾑρέθη πρεσβεύτης δέκατος αὐτός. Cf. 2. 1. 35. 31. postico, ‘the back-door ’
such as has been found in many Pompeian houses. falle, ‘give the slip to.'

EPISTLE VI

Nothing is known of the Numicius to whom this Epistle is addressed, nor
is there any hint to assist us 111 determining the date. Its general purpose is
to recommend a. philosophie calm as the true way of regarding the various
objects of human desire. But from line 31 to the end Horace adopts a tone
of strong irony, urging Numicius, if he will not accept this theory of life, to
pursue with resolute energy whatever end he may choose to propose to himself.

uumoved even ou the yraud pheuomeua of the heaveus. How clo you think thal
we ouyht lo feel wim reyard to ’10εαίίή aud honour? 1. nil admirari

corresponds to Tennyson's ‘wise indifference of the wise ’ ; it is the ἀθαμβία -

of Democritus (Cic. de Fin. 5. 29), cf. Strabo 61 c τὴν ἀθαυμαστίαν, ἣν ὑμνεῖ
Δημόκριτος : the ἀταραξία of the Epicureans 3 the ἀπάθεια of the Stoics. The
admirari would naturally bring along with it the optare and expetere, with
which it is often conj0ined; ay. Cic. de Off. 1. 20. 66, where one of the marks
of a ‘fortis animus et maquus ' is cum persuasum est nihil homiuem uisi quod
honestum decorumque sit aut admirari aut optare aut, expetere oportere.
3. hunc, ‘ yon.' 4. momentiS, ⁴ coursea’ the τροπή of Epicurus (Diog.
Laert. 10. 76); cf. 1. 10. 16. formidine, ‘dread‚' 110. superstitious
alarm. 5. inbuti: cf. 1. 2. 69 11.; Cic. de Fin. 1. 18. 60 superstitio, qua
qui est inbutus, quietus esse ‘nunquam potest: translate ⁴ without a touch of
dread.' quid censes, ‘what think you of ‘3 ’ ‘what about the gifts . . . ’ζ’
The words rhetorically introduce a fresh subject 3 Orelli quotes Cic. de Off. 2. 7.
25 quid censemus superiorem illum Dionysium, quo cruciatu timoris anqi soli-
tum? pro Rosc. 17. 49 quid censes huuc ipsum Sex. Roscium, quo studio et
qua intelliqeutia esse iu rusticis rebus? 7. ludicra quid, plausus . . .
This line is punctuated and explained in many ways: (1) ludicra quid,
plausus, et . . . , ludicra being taken=‘ games,' but (a) though the sing. has
this sense, the plur. is without authority, (b) with et following another copula
is needed before plausus; (2) ludicra quid plausus et . . . ‚ plausus being gen.
after ludicra ‘the toys of applausess i.e. ‘worthless applause,' so that line 7
refers to the prizes of , ambition as line 6 to those of covetousness, but (a)
plausus is not a word which lends itself naturally to this genitiva] construc-
tion, and (b) Horace would hardly, in asking what value is to be set upon
these things, express his own opinion in the very form of the question ; (3)
ludicra? quid . . . connecting ludicra with maris, but (a) this is open to the
last objection, and (b) ludicra maris is less natural than munera maris ,· (4)
ludicra quid, plausus et . . . where plausus et dona are in apposition to ludicra,
‘ what of such toys as the cheers and honours . . . ’ζ’ Τ1113 involves the same
prejudging of the question 33 (2) and (3), but is perhaps safest. dona: sc.
