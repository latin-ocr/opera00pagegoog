282 HORACE Book 111

Translate ‘ rarely has Retribution with her halting foot left the track of the
guilty though far in front.' Retribution slowly but surely dogs the heels of
the guilty, even though, their crime having been committed long before (cf.
antecedentem), they might think they had escaped; cf. Aesch. Ag. 58 Ζεὺς . . .
ὑστερόποινον πέμπει παραβᾶσιν Ἐρινύν, ‘ Zeus sends after transgressors a late-
avenyiny Fury.’ 30. integrum. For deriv. cf. 2. 4. 22 n. Here of one
in whom there is no flaw, ‘a holy man‚' cf. 1. 22. 1 inteyer vitae. 32.
deseruit pede Poena claudo. The alliteration and rhythm seem to suggest
the ‘halting gait.' claudo t very emphatic by position: ⁶ though lame.'

ODE III

‘ The man who is upriyht in purpose and strony in will nothiny in heaven
or earth ean shake. By those qualities mortals have become divine, Pollusc,
H ercules‚—yea‚ and Auyustus also—Bacchus, τοο, and especially Rome's first
< founder Quirinus who was allowed to enter heaven, sor Juno's words were
welcome to the yods when she declared that her wrath ayainst Troy and Troy'an
yuilt had been appeased .· so lony as Troy remained in ruins a lair for the wild
beasts, to the yreat descendants of the Trojans the path to ylory and to
world-wide empire was open : only let them beware of the yreed of 9ain, and
remember that if ever they souyht to rebuild the old Troy, if ever those walls
rose ayain, again too would her ancient wrath arise with ruin to the racel

Lines 1-16 are similar in thought to Ode 2, and seem like the whole of the
first six Odes to have a didactic purpose, but at line 17 the poet breaks off into
a dramatic description of which it is not easy to see the purpose. We know
of no adequate historica] reason for the introduction of so strong a warning
against the rebuilding of Troy3 Suetonius (Caes. 79) does indeed tell us of a
rumour that Julius Caesar intended to remove the seat of empire to Alexandria
or Ilium, but it is difficult to imagine either that such a rumour could have
been circulated' about the calm and philosophie Augustus or that he would
have resorted to such a method of refuting it as these lines would furnish,
while the connexion between the rebuilding of Troy and the opening lines is
still left unexplained. Pliiss (followed by Sellar and Kiessling) gives a reason-
able solution of the difficulty : the clue to the Ode which he furnishes is this z

Uprightness and strength of will have won for individuals fame and im-
mortality: by these virtues Romulus the founder of Rome reached heaven3
by these Rome has broken the ban that rested upon Troy, and shall attain to
universal empire. Only she must (1) look upon that empire as a responsi-
bility and not a means for sels-enrichment‚ (2) she must not imagine that she
can restore that which has been doomed to destruction, i.e. apart from symbol-
ism, she must give up the old Republic and accept the new Monarchy as the
divinely appointed condition of her continuance.
