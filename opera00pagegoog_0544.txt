suppose that the soil of the farm was stony. 88. media de nocte, ‘ while
it is still the middle of the night' (cf. 1. 2. 32; Roby 1911, S. G. 812):

caballum: usually of a riding horse, as in 1. 14. 43 ; S. 1. 6. 59, but here

(Gell. 11. 6 ; Μ33101). 1. 12. 28), though the latter preferred as a rule mecastor,

Genium: for this tutelary spirit cf. 2. 2. 187 and Preller, Ro'm. Myth. 567 :
‘ the genius as such is always good, and the source of the good gifts and hours
which brighten the life of the individual man, and also the source of his
physical and mental health, in a word, his good spirit: hence the oaths and

light of his body, or his Penates, ie. the sanctities of his house and home, are
often named.' 96. qui semel sepe-311¹. . . . Horace, after his fashion,

EPISTLE VIII

This Epistle was written in 20 B.c.‚ and 13 addressed to the Celsus Albino-
