requirat. The full construction would be something of this sort, ut in populo
(fieri potest) : ‘if my dress and slaves had attracted the gaze of any 0116, as may
or may not happen in the throng.' 80. crederet: cf. 1. 3. 4 n. The
imperf. subj. both 111 prose and verse is frequently used where the pluperfect
might be expected ε cf. Virg. Aen. 8. 643 at tu dictis, Albane, maneres, ‘ you
should have stood by your word' ; Plaut. Pseud. l. 3. 53 iam haberes: in-
venires mutuom, ‘you should have had it by this time: you should have

borrowed.' 81. ipse. Horace's father would not trust him to any paed-
ayoyus, but acted in that capacity himself.
85. olim, ‘one day,' ‘bye-and-bye.' 86. praece. It would seem

from this passage that Horace was originally intended to become airauctioneer:
coactor, ‘ a collector‚' either of taxes or of money bid at auctions. See In'tr.
p. viii. 87. at hoc nunc, i.e. because he might have made me a praeeo
or coactor, I· owe him, as matters stand (nunc), all the more gratitude. 89.
1111 me paeniteat, ‘l never can be ashamed of such a father, while in my
senses ²: paeniteat is potential, not optative, equivalent to a future, and the

words are a strong denial. - 90. dolo Suozculpa sua, a Juristic use. 92.
istis: dat„ cf. 1. 4. 48; Od. 2. 2. 18.

94. a certis annis, ‘beginning at some fixed year' (for instance, let us
suppose, five, or six). 95. ad. fastum, ‘to suit his pride.’ quoscumque
is best joined to optaret, and so most editors print. Holder and Fritzsche,
placing a colon at parenteS, take optaret sibi quisque separately: ‘ each
man might choose for himself ² 3 but a parallel to alios quoscumque, taken
absolutely, is hard to find. 96. honestos=elecoratosz cf. line 36. 97.
fascibus. The consuls and praetors had the right to the fasces: they and
the censors and curule aediles had the sella curulis, an ivory chair without
back or arms. 98. sanus [iudicio] tuo: eyreyie hoc dixit quia Maecenas
eques Romanus permansit contempto senatorio ordine—Acron.

101. salutandi. This includes calling on others, and receiving their calls.
The best commentary on the words is furnished by Jerome, Ep. 43 pudet
dicere frequentiam salutandi qua aut ipsi quotidie ad alios peryimus aut ael
nos venientes ceteros exspectamus. The duty of attending morning levees
became a great burden, repeatedly referred to by Juvenal and Martial.
ducendus et=et ducendus, 102. peregreve: for the hypermeter,
ef. 1. 4. 963 Virg. Gr. 1. 2953 2. 3443 3. 242, 449. peregre is ‘to
foreign parts,' or, elsewhere, ‘from foreign parts.’ pereyri is ‘ abroad.’
103. calones, ‘ grooms.' 104. petorritum is a four-wheeled carriage‚
especially used by servants, pilenta vehicula matronarum sieut petorrita famu-
lorum Comm. Oruq. on Ep. 2. 1. 192. This suits ducenda here well; the
meaning being, ‘ I should have to bring along with me a train of waggons
carrying the slaves and luggage.' The word, like reela and essedum, is of
Celtic origin, from pam-:quattuor ,· rra=r0ta curto: sometimes ex-
plained ‘bobtailed,’ curtata cauda, but better humble, unpretending3 cf.
curta supellex, curta rea 105. ire mulo. So ire pedibus, equis, curru,
etc. 106. mantica, ‘ portmanteau ' (manus). armi nearly always in
good Latin the shoulders of a beast : umeri, of a man. When Ovid says, Met.
12. 396, ese unieris medios coma dependebat in armoe, one might guess he was
speaking of the Centaurs who had both. Porph. obseryed that Horace is here
copying Lucilius (1023 Lach.) mantica cantheri costas yravitate premebat.

107. Tillius having re-acquired senatorial rank (11116 24 11.) and obtained
the praetorship, exhibits ostentation and ωε combined. His ostentation
