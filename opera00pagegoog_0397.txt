plan to be rid os our troubles is to fly, like tlte old Phocaeam, bindiny ourselves
by cm oath never to return until the laws of nature are all chanyed (15-34).
Be this the resolve os those among] us who have a {Joocl hear-t, aad let us set saz'l
sor that circumambient Ocean (41) in which are the Happy Isles‚ where toil and
trouble and siolmess are unknmon—Isles‚ which. as yet uo bar-lt· lzas ever reached,
but which. Jupiter reserved for a riqhteous people in tlte day when he turned
the aye of yold to brass and then to iron, and where tlte riyhteous, with me as
their prophet-barti, may ‘now find a refuge. ’ -

Like the seventh, an Epode in which Horace is tuning his lyre 1ο loftier
3116103. It is undoubtedly early (see notes on lines 49, 55, 57 for its similarity
to Eclogue 4) and usually assigned 1ο about 13.c. 41, the date of the ‘Perusine
war’ between L. Antonius and Octavian. The idea of setting sail for the
Happy Islands is ascribed 10 Sertorius by Sallust (F ragm. 1. 61) traditur
fugam in Oceani lonqinqua ayitasse, euius duas insulas propinquas inter se et
elecem milia stadium procul a Gadibus sitas constabat suopte irzyenio alimenta
mortalibus yiynere,· Plut. Sert. 9.

1. altera, ‘a second': the first ‘generation ' would begin in the time of
Marius and Sulla, about B.c. 88. 2. suis . . . ‘and Rome falls by its
own might,’ 226. is being destroyed by its own mighty men, who ruin it by
internecine strife, cf. 7. 10; Matt. xii. 253 Luke xi. 17. Editors compare
Liv. Praef. res . . . ut ‘iam maqnitudine laboret sua ; Aug. de Civ. D. 18. 45
Roma . . . tamquam se z'psa ferre ‘non valens, sua se quodammodo rralqrzitudine
,fis-essem& Lucan 1. 72 nee se Roma ferens, and Od. 3. 4. 65 mole ruit sua .-
but in all these cases Rome is spoken of as something which has become too
big to bear its own weight and therefore falls necessarily, whereas in connexion
with ⁶ civil strife' the force of suis and ipsa must be to express suicidal con-
duct which destroys what is otherwise absolutelyvstable. 3. Marsi. In
the Social war B.c. 91-883 Od. 3. 14. 18 11. 4. Etrusca: so 40, S. 1. 6. 1;

10. 61, but with F} 10118 Od. 1. 2. 14, 3. 29. 35, 0. S. 38. Porsenae, but
Porsenna in Virg.; see Intr. to Macaulay's Horatius.

5. aemula. Capua revolted from Rome after Cannae and was retaken
13.o. 211. It was treated with ruthless severity, for Rome brooked no ‘rival' ;
cf. sor the adj. 7. 5 invidae Karthaginis. Spartacus: od. 3. 14. 19 11.
6. novisque . . . ‘and the Allobroges faithless amid (01 ‘to’ or ‘by')
revolution.’ The ambassadors of the Allobroges (a people between 1116 Rhone
and the Isere in the Insula Allobroqum) were tampered with by Catiline (13.6.
63), but revealed the secret of his conspiracy ; the Allobroges however revolted
almost immediately afterwards, novis rebus may be dat. ‘faithless to
Catiline ’ or abl. causal, ‘by desire for revolution‚' or general abl. of attendant
circumstances. 7. caerulea, ‘blue-eyed ’ ; Tac. Germ. 4 truces et caerulei
oculi. Germania ε 1116 reference is to the defeat of the Cimbri and Ten·
tonos by Marius 13.c. 102 and 101. 8. abominatus με cf. Od. 1. 1. 25 n.
9. devoti sanguinis, ‘ of a doomed breed‚’ because sprung from Romulus
the slayer of his brother‚·cf. 7. 20. 11. cinerem of Rome. 12. sonante,
‘clattering‚' ‘ echoing‚' in contrast with the silence and desolation around. cf.
Ezekiel xxvi. 11 unyulis equorum suorum conculcabit omnes plateas tuas.

13. carent ventis . . . ‘are safe from wind and sun, πλε. 111 1116 tomb.
This is inconsistent with the carrying off of Romulus to heaven, Od. 3. 3. 15 3
but rhetoricians and poets may defy consistency. Porphyrion quotes Varro
as referring to a ‘burial place of Romulus behind the Restm? Cf. Jer. viii. 1
