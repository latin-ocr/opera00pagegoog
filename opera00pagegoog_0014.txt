viii HORACE

was always deeply sensible, and the passage (S. l. 6. 68 seq.) in
which he answers the sneers of society on his origin by a full acknow-
ledgment of how much he owed to ‘the best of fathers ’ is possibly
not among the most rhetorical, but is certainly⁷ among the most
touching passages in classical literature.

When his school-days were over he went, after the fashion of
the time, to complete his studies ‘at what was practically the
University of Athens, ‘ searching for truth amid the groves of the
Academy ² 1 or, in other wordS, reading philosophy. Here he made
the acquaintance of M. J unius BrutuS, who after the murder of
Caesar (44 Rc.) had been driven from Italy and visited Athens
before taking up as propraetor the government of Macedonia.
Horace seems to have gone with him to Asia Minor2 and, when
Brutus and Cassius raised a republican force with which to resist
Octavian and Antony, he was appointed a military tribune and
found himself, as he puts it with intentional exaggeration, ‘in
command of a Roman legion.' 3 He took part in the battle of
Philippi (42 Bo), which finally extinguished the hopes of the
republican party, and, though his own description of himself as
spirited away by Mercury the protector of poets and ‘leaving his
poor shield ingloriously behind him' 4 must not be taken too
literally, still we may well imagine that his exploits on that fatal
field were not very distinguished. At any rate his military and
republican ardour soon cooled and, instead of following his friends
farther amid the ‘stormy seas' 5 of war, he took advantage of an
amnesty offered by the conquerors and returned to Italy, where he
found himself ‘ with his wings clipped and destitute of house and
farm,' 6 his property near Venusia having probably been confiscated
and assigned to some veteran of the victorious army.

By some meam, however, he managed to procure a sort . of
clerkship in the treasury ⁷ on which to live. Meantime some of

his writings, possibly some of the earlier Satires (ay. 1. 7), attracted ,

the notice of Varius and Virgil, who in 39 B.c. procured for the
timid and stammering clerk an introduction to O. Cilnius Maecenas,
the peace minister of Augustus and the great literary patron of
the age. After a delay of nine months, during which Maecenas
seems to have satisfied himself as to the talent and character of
Horace, he welcomed him as an intimate member of that famous
literary group which the great statesman loved to collect around
