τῖε. without needing to be grafted on another stock3 cf. Virg. G. 2. 82
miraturque novas frondes ec ‘non sua poma, said of the stoek in which a graft
has been placed. 47. mella . . . cf. od. 2. 19. 12 and the Biblical
phrase ‘a land flowing with milk and honey.’ Abundance of honey is a
constant sign of felicity with the ancients, who, having no sugar, made much
more use of honey than we do· 48. N otice the rhythm.

49. illic . . . So in the same connexion Virg. Ecl. 4. 21 (written about
B.c. 40) ipsae lacte domum referent distenta capellae Ι ubera, where ipsae:
iniussae here, and distenta u.=tenta u. 50. amicus, ⁴ loving‚' and so needing
no constraint, but coming ‘unbidden.' 52. neque . . . An artificia]
phrase: ‘nor does the ground swell up and heave with snakes,' being: ‘ nor
do snakes, which cover the ground, swell (ie in anger) and raise themselves
(πλε. to attack).’ Others take alta humus of ‘ deep soil' as opposed to the
rocky, dry, sandy spots which vipers love. 53. pluraque . . . ‘ and
more things shall we marvel at . . . (namely) how . . . '. For miror ut cf.
Od. 3. 4. 12. 54. radat, ‘sconis' 55. Note the careful balance ancl order
of this line—adj. A, adj. B, verb, noun A, noun B, and cf. lines 7, 33 3 Virg.
Ecl. 4. 4 ultima G‘umaei venit iam carminis aetas, 14 inrita perpetua solvent
formidine terras, 23 ipsa tibi blandos fundent cunabula flores, 29 incultisque
rubens pendebit sentibus uva. The tendency thus to balance adjectives at the
beginning of a line with nouns at the end is- marked throughout this Epode
(cf. lines 2, 4, 9, 34, 46, 48, 57, 59, 63), as it is in Eclogue 4, and rather in-
dicates juvenile work, although some of the finest effects in Virgil owe much
to the same device, cf. G. 1. 468 inpiaque aeternam timuerunt saecula noctem,

and lines 495, 497, 508, 510. 56. utrumque, τῖε. ‘each' extreme of
wet and drought.

57. non huc . . . πλε. they have never been contaminated by any of those
restless adventurers (typified by J ason in pursujt of the golden fieece) and
merchants, for whom Horace has a hearty dislike, cf. Od. 1. 3 3 3. 29. 57-61.
Similarly in Virg. Ecl. 4. 32 ‘ tempting the sea in ships ' and the ‘ building of
the Argo ' are marks of ‘ guile,’ and in the golden age that is coming there will
be no sailors and no merchants. 59. Sidonii. The Phoenicians were the
great traders of antiquity3 cf. Od. 3. 29. 60 Tyriaeque merces‚· Is. xxiii. 2
‘the merchants of Zidon '3 8 ‘Tyre . . . whose merchants are princes.'

cornua, κέρατα, the ends of the yards. 60. laboriosa c. ‘ much-endur-
ing troop ' z πολύτλας, the Homeric epithet of Ulysses himself (cf. 17. 16), is
transferred to his followers. 61. astri: such as Sirius, the dog-star, to

the ‘ fiegg⁴ fierceness ’ of which the malignant heat of summer was attributed
(cf. 1. 2 ; 1rg. Aen. 3. 141). 62. For inpotentia of ‘uncontrolled
fierceness ' cf. note on inpotens Od. 1. 37. 10. 64. aere . . . aere: cf.
Od. 1. 2. 4 n. 65. duravit, ‘he made hard,' playing on the word durus,
which can be used (1) literally of iron, (2) metaphorically (a)=enduring
trouble, (b) :hm-d, cruel. quorum, ‘ from which,' with fuya.
