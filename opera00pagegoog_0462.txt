H. N. 7. 44. 144. 68. famosis, ‘libellous ’ ; cf. Ep. 1. 19. 31 11. Lupo:

L. Cornelius Lentulus Lupus, consul 156 B.c. Lucilius attacked him fiercely ; .

cf. Pers, 1. 114 secuit Lucilius urbem, Ι te, Lupe, ie, Muci, el gyenuinum
fregit in illis. cooperto, ‘ overwhelmed with‚' as with a volley of stones or
javelinS. atqui still belongs to Horace3 ‘and yet ’ he was unsparing in
his satire. 69. tributim: properly ‘tribe by tribe‚' i.e. he made no
distinctions3 cf. vicatim Epod. 5. 97.

71. a vulgo et scaena, ‘ from the throng and theatro of public life.'
For scaena in this metaphorical sense, cf. Cic. Lael. 26. 67 in scaena, id est,
in concione. 72. virtue Scipiadae . . . sapientia Laeli: cf. Od.
3. 21. 11 Catonis . . . virium Juv. 4. 81 Crispi iucunda seneclus. mitis:
Laelius was always regarded as the personification of ⁶ mild‚' or ‘mellow'
wisdom. Sen. Ep. 11 fin. contrasts him with the strict Cato as remissioris
animi virum. 73. nugari, ‘fool ' 3 like dulce esi desipere in loco Od. 4.
12. 28. Cicero tells us (de Or. 2. 6. 22) how Laelius and Scipio used to
become boys again (repuerascere), when they had scampered off to the country
from town, as if from bondage, how they picked 8110118 011 the shore, and
stooped to every method of relaxing the mind : ad omnem animi remissionem
ludumque descendere. discincti, lit. ‘ungirt,’ without the cinqulum or
zona: here metaphorically ‘ without restraint.' donec . . . holus,
‘till the cabbage was boiled': coquere often=‘to boil‚’ as 2. 8. 483 so the
German kochen. Whenever the Roman poets wished to sing the praises of a
frugal diet, vegetables are the fare, e.9. Ep. 1. 5. 2. 75. censum, ‘fortuna’
‘ rank? Lucilius was an eques, granduncle of Pompey the Great. 76. cum
magnis: so Ep. 1. 20. 23 me primis urbis belli placuisse domique. 78.
offendet solido: the metaphor is probably from unexpectedly coming on
a grit in a piece of bread.

79. hinc, ‘in what you have said.’ diffingere, ‘alten' ‘improve upon ' 3
cf. the use of the word Od. 1. 35. 393 3. 29. 47. MS. authority is equally good
for diffindere, which is explained ‘break off from ’ 3 cf. 2. 2. 127 quantum hinc
inminuei, but this sense of the word (whichz ‘ split open ’) is unexampled.
80. ut, ‘in order that,' belongs to caveas, not to monitus : after legum, in line
81, understand ‘let me remind you of this: hoc scite. So 2. 2. 112 ; Ep. 1. 1.

. 13 ; Cic. de N. D. 1. 7. 17 sed ut liic qui intervenit me intuens inquil'ne iynoret

quae res ayaiur .· de natura ayebamus deorum. 82. mala : Horace plays‘on
the double meaning of the word. In Trebatius' mouth it meant ‘ libellous ² ε
Horace uses it as simply ‘bad,' i. e. poor poetry 3 perhaps ‘ scandalous verse ' would
preserve both meanings. condiderit was the very word used in the XII Tables
Cic. de Rep. 4. 10. 12 nostrae XII tabulae cum perpaucas res capite sanccissent
in his hanc quoque sanciendam putaverunt si quis occentavisset sive carmen
condidisset, quod infamiam faceret flayiiiumve alieri. For condiderit, cf. 1.
5. 90 n. 84. There is no necessity to take Caesare with laudatus. iudice
Caesare may be abl. abs„ as Orelli takes it. See Od. 1. 6. 1 n. 85. Horace
three times uses latrare for allatrare ‘to bay at‚' Epod. 5. 58 ; Ep. 1. 2. 66.
So ὑλακτεῖν takes an accusative. integer ipse is not a new question, but
‘while he himself is whole,' i.e. pure from vice; cf. Od. 1. 22. 1. 86.
solventur risu tabulae, ‘ the indictment will be laughed out of court.'

tabulae is not elsewhere used for an indictment: but it is a word of very *

general use, and here would naturally denote the tabulae ceratae on which
the indictment was written, at any rate in early times : cf. Aristoph. Nub. 770,
where Strepsiades proposes to get a burning-glass to melt the letters out of
