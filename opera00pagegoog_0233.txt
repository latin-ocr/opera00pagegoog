ODE V

‘ Who is thy lover ηοω, Pyrrha? He little Imows that theu art fickle as the
3οα .· all smiles zio-day, to-morww stom. Poor inexperieuced youth! I have
90ηο throuyh similar danqers aud escaped, thauk heaven)

A slight Ode, but singular-ly beautiful in expression: it is in Horace's
best style, and is apparently perfectly simple because perfectly finished ;
summa ars celavit artem. Any one who disagrees should attempt to omit or
alter a single word. It is translated by Milton (Occasional Poems).

1. multa in rosa urguet, ‘courts thee amid many a rose.' 3. Pyrrha
from πυρῤῥόςε ‘ the wiburn-heire& cf. flavam. 5. simplex munditiiS,
‘simple in thy elegance.’ For the adj. mundus see 3. 29. 14 11. munditiae
applied to 3 13(19’3 10110110 indicates the presence of elegance and taste with·
out ostentation or extravagance. munditiis capimur says Ovid truly A. A. 3.
133. Milton's ‘plain in thy neatness ’ savours rather of the Puritan than the
poet. 8. emirabitur insolens. emiror is only found here: it is a very
strong form of miror. insolens, ‘unused‚’ i.e. 10 311011 fickleness. The line
should be read over aloud, placing 311033 011 1110 11111131 spondees: its full
force will be at once clear.
