at court seemed to require a check.

πράττειν : cf. Plaut. Trin. 3. 3. 43 salutem ei nuntiet verb-is patris .· illmn bene

duties as secretary (seriba): ‘ wishes for his success in his new office!
Albinovano: an instance of an aynomen added to a coynomen, as in the
case of the poet Pedo Albinovanus. The origin of the name is obscure;
Ritter suggests Albium Intimalium (now Ventimiqlia) in Liguria as its
possible derivation. 2. rogata: sc. a me, ‘at my request! refer, ‘‚bear’

‘deliver‚’ as often with ‘mandata etc„ where re has the meaning not of ‘ssback
but of execution of a duty3 cf. the similar use of ἀποδίδωμι. comiti: cf.
1. 3. 6 n. 3. multa et pulchra minantem‚‘ in spite of many fine
promises‚' not limited to literary work, but extending to the conduct of lise
generally. For the phrase see S. 2. 3. 9. 4. grando: cf. Od. 3. 1. 29.

testimony of Servius on Aen. '4. 244, which is older than any of our MSS. It

bellum with 9. 16. 4 itaque subinde eaesecuntur ἱερατί- but is not used by any
earlier author. 17. ut tu. .The tendency to vanity, which seems to
have exposed Celsus to the danger of publishing poems with little originality
in them (1. 3. 15), here called for a friendly warning, strangely misunderstood
by some editors, who have found in it a serious censure.

EPISTLE IX

Septimius, on whose behalf this chat-ming letter of introduction was addressed
to Tiberius Claudius, was undoubtedly the friend who is greeted with so much
affection in Od. 2. 6. There is nothing to determine the date.

1-13. Septimius qs course knowe better than I do, Claudiu8‚ what influence
I have avith you. I have tried to excuse myself, but I would rather appear
’ forward than sdfish, and therefore I venture to introduce him to you as wmthy

of your friendship. 1. nimirum, ‘ of course ’ 3 used by Horace ironically
.in S. 2. 2. 106, but not in 1. 14. 11; 15. 423 2. 2. 141; S. 2. 3. 120.
