292 HORAOE BOOK 111

Regulus as being capitis minor was now only able consiliam dare ‘ to give
advice,' and he must therefore explain numquam alias dato as expressing that
Regulus ‘ had at no other time so given mansel! Such an explanation seems
too recondite: surely the words mean, ‘with counsel such as ne'er before
was given,’ and refer to the unprecedented nobility of the counsel with which
Regulus counselled his own certain death. 48. egregius exsul: oxy-
moron. properaret: emphatic: he ‘hastens ' lest he be recalled.

49. atqui: 1. 23. 9 n. 50. non aliter: with quam si, line 53.
51. dimovit : from olis and movere, ‘to make to stand apart,' so as to form a
lane down which one may pass. 53. clientum . . . relinqueret, ‘ he
were leaving the tedious business of his clients, their suits decided.' The
patronus gave advice and assistance to his clients (clientes, κλύοντες, ‘ those
who listen ')‚ especially on legal matters, the old Roman aristocracy all
possessing legal training: this he would do at Rome, after which he would be
free to seek the repose of his country estates, 55. Venafranos . . .
Tarentum. Local colouring to give reality and distinctness‚ see 1. 1. 13 n.
See too 3. 7. 1-8 Favonii, Thyna, Notis, Oricum, Caprae. As here, Horace
frequently selects his names a good deal for their harmonicus sound. More-
over the quiet ending of the Ode affords an artistic contrast to the rhetorical
emphasis of the rest, cf. 4. 2. 60 n.‚ 4. 14. 52 n. 56. Lacedaemonium:
because founded by Phalanthus‚ for whom see Class. Dict.

ODE VI

‘ The sins of the fathers will be visited upon the children until the crumbliny
temples os the qods are restored: lo reverenee for the yods we owe the rise ofoar
empire, to our παρίασί of them we shall owe its rain ; let the defeals we have
already suffered be a warni‘ny to us. M oreover immoraMty, like a rising] floocl,
has over-spread the walion aad sapped the foundations of that simple household
life in which were reared the early soldiers of Rome. Ala3‚ so we move from
bad to worse!

'Phe Ode commemor-ates two portions of the domestic policy of Augustus,
(1) 'Ibe restoration of many decayed temples (Virgil, Aen. 8. 716, says 300) as
a visible sign of his desire to restore the old customs and observances of Rome,
cf. Ovid, Fast. 2. 63 templorum positor, templorum sancte repostor; (2) the
introduction of several measures intended to check the continual decrease in
the number of regular marriages which was due partly to decay of religious
feeling and a consequent looseness of moraIs, partly to increased cost of living
and the more luxurious habits of society. See Dict. Ant. Lem Iulia Papia el
Poppaea, and cf. 3. 24 and 4. 5. 21-24 3 Merivale‚ c. 33.

1. delicta . . . Orelli quotes a fragment of Euripides τὰ τῶν τεκόντων
σφάλματ’ εἰς τοὺς ἐκγόνους Ι οἱ θεοὶ τρέπουσι, which reproduces the very words
of Exod. xx. 5 ‘ I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity
of the fathers upon the children.’ 2. Romane. For the singular cf. Virg.
Aen. 6. 851 lu reyere imperio populos Romane, memento. 3. labentes,
‘ mouldering 'z labi, ‘to slip,' ‘glide,' ‘ fall away‚' is admirably used of the
sure but silent process of decay. N otice the different quantity and meaning
of labantes 3. 5. 45. 5. dis . . . imper-ae, ‘the lord of mankind only
because thou art the servant of the gods.’—Merivale. Cf. 1. 12. 57 te minor
latum reyel aequus orbem, and 3. 1. 5 n. te minorem geris, ‘ dost carry
thyself (as) inferior,’ ‘behave thyself as the servant! 6. hinc, ‘ from this:
