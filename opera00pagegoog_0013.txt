INTRODUCTION

Q. HonAtrms FLACCUS was born on Dec. 8, 65 Β.0., in the
consulship of L. Aurelius Cotta and L. Manlius Torquatus‚1 five
years after Virgil and two years before O. OctaviUS, who sub-
sequently became the emperor Augustus. The place of his birth
was Venusia, a town in Apulia on the borders of Lucania 2 close to
Mount Vultur and the ‘ far-echoing Aufidus.' 3 His father was a
‘freedman ² (libertinus),4 and had been a ‘collector,’ 5 probably of
taxes, though others credit him with having been a ‘dealer in
salt-fish.’ 6 Anyhow, when the young Horace was old enough to
go to school, he had apparently saved a fair amount of money,
though his son describes him as only ‘ the poor owner of a lean
farm,' ⁷ and he was certainly a man who deserves not to be for-
gotten. Freedman, tax-collector, and perhaps fish-hawker, he
none the less saw the talent of his son and resolved to give him a
chance in the world. Instead of sending him to the local school,
where ‘ the big 80118 of big centurionS, satohel and slate slung
over their left arms,' 8 went carrying their monthly peuce, he took
him to Rome and procured for him the best teachers, notably 3
certain Orbilius Pupillus of Beneventum—the Keate 9 of his day
—whose birch 1⁰ and whose Iessons in Livius Andronicus left an
impression on the pupil which has immortalised the master.
Not only did his father spend money freely on him but he devoted
himself personally to watching over the growth of his morals and
character, and to inculcating on him such shrewd and homely maxims
as his own experience dictated. Of the debt thus incurred the son
