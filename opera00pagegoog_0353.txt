country he ruled over, was so, For gen. cf. 3. 6. 17 n. 12. regnavit
populorum. A Greek construction : ἄρχειν, κρατεῖν, τυραννεύειν, all take a
genitive. ex humili potens, Horace, far from the folly of attempting
to conceal his origin, always dwells on it with pride as making the glory of
his success greater (cf. 2. 20. 6). ex: cf. Soph. O. Τ. 454 τυφλὸς ἐκ δεδορ-
noros: Virg. Aen. 10. 221 Nymphas e navibus ; J uv. 5. 134 quantus ex nihilo.

13. Aeolium carmen. Lyrics such as those of Sappho and Alcaeus, who
used the Aeolic dialect, cf. 2. 13. 24, 4. 3. 12. ad Italos modos: the
words must not be pressed too closely: the ‘ measures ' or ‘ metres ' that
Horace uses are not ‘ Italian ' but Greek, e. 9. the Alcaic and Sapphic ; what
he means is that he has introduced a new variety of Italian poetry, copied
from Greek models. 14. dedum’sse ε as in the phrase deducere coloniam.
Kiessling gives ‘ to have composed (Ep. 2. 1. 225) an Aeolio song in I. measureS‚’
but surely they were Italian songs in Aeolic measures. 15. quaesitam
meritis, ‘ won by thy desertS.’ Delphica, because the laurel was sacred
to Apollo (4. 2. 9 laurea Apollinari), who is the godof poets and himself ·
plays on the lyre. 16. volens, ‘ of thy grace.’

BOOK iv

THE Fourth Book of the Odes is separated from the preceding three by a con-
siderable period of time. In the concluding Ode of the Third Book Horace

distinctly speaks of his labours as a lyric poet as concluded‚ and the first word ⁷

of the present book calls marked attention to the interval which has elapsed.
The reason for its composition is definitely assigned by Suetonius to the direct
command of Augustus (see Intr. p. xiii), and indeed it is clear that the rest
of the book is only published to afford a plausible pretext for the publication
of Odes 4, 5, 14 and 15: the other odes, which are of a purely lyric character,
serve to mask the distinctly political purpose of these four, which bear
throughout the stamp of the official utterance of a Poet-Laureate. Orelli (ed.
4) notes the number of almost entirely new words used in this book—Faustitas
5. 18 ; beluosus 14. 473 tauriformis 14. 25 ; domabilis 14. 41; inlacrimabilis
(=unwept for) 9. 26 ; inimicare 15. 20 ; adprecari 15. 28 ; obarmare 4. 21;
remi-scere 15. 30 3 aeternare 14. 5. There is also a marked alteration in his
treatment of the caesura iu Sapphics, see Notes on Metres p. xix. ξ 2.

ODE I

‘ Why summon me, VenuS, to enter aqain the lists of love? I am verqingy
on fifty and not tlze man I once was, It would be more seasonable for thee to
lead thy revels to the house of Paulus Maximus .· he has a hundred qualities
which will make him thy ποττὰς] champion‚ and in return for thy favours will
dedicate to thee a temple. To me love and yaiety have lost their charms. And
yet, even as I write, I find the old emotions retain their away, I betray every
siyn ospassion.'

Horace professes that he resumes his pen merely to celebrate again the
power of love, and thus endeavours to vei] his real purpose.
