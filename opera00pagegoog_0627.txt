Pon‘rmA NOTES 599

wrote Nerei repandirostrum incumcemmcm pet-ue. Crates (quoted by Athen.
10. 418 c) speaks of ἔπη τριπήχη Θετταλικῶς τετμημένα, tle. cut into big
pieces, such as the ThessaIIan gluttons loved. 98. Si curat cor: the
neglect of the caesura is intentional, to imitate the carelessness of artistic form
in one feeling decply. For the perf. infin. cf. Ep. 1. 17. 5 n.

99. pulchra, ‘ fine ' when judged by the canons of art: dulcia,
‘ charming ’ to the feelings and hearts of the readers, Gesner quotes the
French saying: La beaute est pour Z’espo-it, Za doueeur est pour le coeur.
101. adsunt is the reading of the MSS. supported by Acron’s in praesto sunt.
Bentley eagerly accepted adflent, the suggestion of some earlier scholars. But
the threefold repetition of flere would be far from elegant, and the antithesis
would be disagreeably forced with this reading. For adesse ‘ to support '
with help and sympathy cf. line 204, Ep. 1. 17. 57 : so often in Cic. and Livy.
102. dolendum est: Acron here quotes illud Ciceronis ‘ardeat orator, si
molt iudicem incendere,' apparently an inaccurate reminiscence of Cic. de Orat.
2: 45. 189, 190. Porphyrion quotes a story of Demosthenes declining to
plead the cause of a man who said he had been beaten, because he told the
story without any emotion, and only undertaking the case when the man
repeated the tale of his wrongs for the third time, with tears of indignation.
104. male mandata go together, and the participle really expresses the
main proposition : ‘if the words which you utter are ill assigned to you‚’ πλε.
unsuited to your position and emotions.

105. maestum, ‘ deJectedj almost always of an outward expression of
grief: hence dolor and ‘maeror are contrasted in Cic. ad Att. 12. 28 ; Phil.
11. 1. 107. lasciva, ‘ sportivc,' with no evil connotation. The word is
used ten times by Horace, and never in a distinctly bad sense ε cf. Ep. 2. 2. 216.
severum Seria: ⁴ iuter serius et severus hoe dtseriminis est, ut prius fere
sem-per dieitur de ‘rebus³ posterius de hominibus '--Ruhnken on Ter. Eun. 3.
3. 7. 109. iuvat, ‘gladdens‚’ rare 10 this sense as a persona] verb; and
perhaps only here with a person not a thing as the subJect. habitum:
ἕξιν or σχῆμα ‘ condition.' 111. motus, probably never, even in poetry,
used without animi for ‘ emotion.' interprete lingua, ‘ by the agency
of the tongue.'

113. equites peditesque, ‘ one and all ‘ from the highest to the lowest.
Bentley objects (1) that the phrase is never used to cover the whole people,
except with a distinctly military reference, or as in Livy 1. 44 edixit ut munes
cives Romani, equites peditesque, in suis quisque centuriis iu campo Martio
adessent ,· (2) that Horace professes elsewhere to care only for the judgment
of the educated (cf. S. 1. 10. 76 satis est equitem mihi plamtere) ; and therefore
bids us read equitesque patresque ‘librariorum populo valere iusso? This read-
ing receives some support from Mart. 14. 120, where the phrase is used of the
educated as opposed to the unlearned : quamvis me Ziqutam dieunt equitesque
patresque, Ι dicor ab indoctis zinyula qrammatieiS. But here the expression is
more forcible‚ if all the audience is supposed to laugh at the incongruity of
language, and there is nothing unnatural in the phrase, used with a certain

tone of sportiveness. cachinnum est verbum seeundum ὀνοματοποιΐαν
fictum a sono mus—Acron. 114. divuene an heros: this reading has

the support of by far the most and the best MSS. But some have thought
that the contrast between a god and a hero is not as great as the context
requires ε hence Erasmus cleverly suggested divesne . . . cm Irus (the beggar of
the Odyssey), while Landinus would read Davusne . . . Izemsne, accepting
