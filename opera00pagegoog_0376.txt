ODE XIII

⁶ The yods have heard my prayers .· you are becomiuy old aud uyly, Lyce,
aud yet you still act like a youny yirl, aud seelc to awalceu love. Love prefers
fuir Chloe’s cheelc8‚ aud rudely wiuys his fliyht past wizeued aye, to which no
ornaments cau briuy baele its former charms, the charms which ouce stole my beart
from me, when you succeeded Cinara as the queen of my affectione. AZas,
‘poor Cinara, the futes cut her off iu her youth, while you they preserve to a
subulcus aye that the youuy meu may scoff at the ashes of your beauty.'

A sequel to 3. 10 which describes the cruelty and pride of Lyce in her youth.

1. audivere . . . The repetition (cf. 2. 14. 1 11.) expresses exultation‚ just
as we say Hurrah, Hurrah 1 cf. 4. 2. 49. The repetition too of sound in fis
and vis seems intentional : he almost bisses the harsh truth into her ear. For
the inverted order audivere Di . . . Di audivere, cf. 3. 5. 21 11. 5. et
cantu . . . ‘and with quavering notes when in your cups seek to arouse
sluggish Cupid.’ 6. ille. Emphatic: the god, you try in vain to awake,
is wide awake enough elsewhere. virentis, ‘ young‚' ‘in the spring-time of
life.’ ’7. psallere, ψάλλειν, ‘ to touch,' or ‘ twitch with the fingers,' then to
play 011 the' harp, or singbto it, cf. ‘psalm.' Chia, originally an adj. then a
proper name, cf. Delia, Lesbia. 8. pulchris excubat . . . ‘ keeps watch
on the fair cheeks.' excubo is a technical word used of sentinels 011 guard. For
the metaphor cf. Romeo and Juliet, V. iii. 94 ‘ beauty's ensign yet Ι 13 crimson
in thy lips and in thy cheeks, Ι And death's pale flag is not advanced there.'

9. aridas quereus, ‘sapless oaks '3 Lyce is compared to an old and
gnarled oak. 10. te quia . . . te quia. Derisive repetition. ⁴ Shrinks
from you, because your teeth are yellow, from you, because wrinkles give
ugliness and the snow upon your head.' 13. Coae purpurae. Purple
robesof extremely fine silk manufactured at Cos, see Mayor on Juv. 8. 101.
14. clari lapides, ‘ gleaming Jewels ’ ; other MSS. give cari, ‘cost1y.'
tempora . . . ‘ the years which once swift time has shut in safe-guarded in the
public registers.' 15. notis ε added to hint that it is no use Lyce endeavouring
to deny her age ; 1113 public registers bear testimony which cannot be concealed.
condita inclusit. The idea is that of Time stormy up and then Zoclcz'uy iu
the past so that it can never be recovered.

17. venus z as often, ‘ charms‚’ ‘beauty.' color, ι11113,’ ⁶ complexim?
18. quid habes . . . ‘ what have you (left) of her, ah me, of her who breathed
passion . . . ’ζ’ 1111113, ‘her of long ago‚' zze. the old Lyce, the Lyce of former
days. For the repetition cf. 4. 4. 70 n. 3 the effect here is pathetic‚ but the
pathos is used to enhance the mockery.
