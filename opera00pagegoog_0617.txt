defending the school to which he himself, as well as Virgil and Varius, belonged.
But in the latest years of his life the ‘ Augustan ’ school of poetry had already
won a decisive victory, and its leading writers were recognised as classic
models. There was no longer need for the warm and strenuous pleading for
that freedom in dealing with language, which was now generally concedcd: it
was sufficient to assert it quietly in the tone of Ep. 2. 2. 115 seq.

(5) Horace's tone in speaking of himself points to the earlier rather than
to the later date. There is no reference to his advancing years, as aq. in Ep.
2. 2. 55 seq. ‘ There is nothing of the air of a man who is weary and feels that
his work is done ’ (Nettleship). It is true that in line 306 he says that he is
now writing nothing himself 3 but this expression may be referred just as well
to that period of inactivity which followed the publication of Odes I.-III.,
as to that which marked the latest years of his life.

(6) The arguments for thetraditional date drawn from lines 63 seq. break down
upon a more correct interpretation of that passage, for which see notes in loc.

(7 ) There is no trace of intimacy with Augustus in this Epistle. His
name is not even mentioned. Now Horace was probably in very close re-
lations with the Emperor after his return to Rome from the East in 19 B.c.

Many indications therefore agree in pointing to a time not far removed
from the date of the first book of the EpistleS, aa. about 20 B.c., as the (late
of composition. But this date is quite incompatible with the identification of
the Pisos given by Porphyrion, and we should therefore regard this as an
unlucky guess of the scholiast‚ or rather of the unknown authority on whom
he drew. Possibly the young Pisos referred to may be the sons of Gnaeus
Calpurnius Piso, consul 23 B.c. He had fought against Caesar in Africa, and
had afterwards joined Brutus and Cassius. After the amnesty which followed
the battle of Philippi, he had kept aloof from public life, until Augustus
urged him to accept the consulship. He was probably some ten or twelve
years older than Horace. His eldest son Gnaeus was consul in 7 B.c., and
must therefore have been born not later than 40 B.C. ; while the younger son
Lucius was consul in 1 B.c.‚ and therefore born not later than 34 B.c.

The title ‘ Ars Poetica,' or ‘De Arte Poetica Liber‚' is found in almost all
MSS. Quintilian 8. 3. 60 writes id tale est monstrum, quale Horatius in prima
parte libri dc arte poetica finyit ; and in the Epist. ad Tryph. 2 (prefixed to
his Institutio) says usus Horatii consilio, qui in arte poetica suadet, ‘nc prae-
cipitetur alicio, nonumque prematur in annum. Later grammarians regularly
use the same title. Tbere is no evidence that it comes from Horace himself ;
it was probably invented by an early editor, and it is not very suitable to the
contents of the Epistle, suggesting, as it does, a regularity and completeness
of treatment to which the poem makes no claim, and which indeed seems to
be intentionally avoided. But a name which has been so long in use cannot
be abandoned without inconvenience ; and it may be accepted on the authority
of tradition, provided we do not allow it to mislead us as to the real character
of the Epistle. The Epistle is certainly not a complete ‘ Art of Poetry.’ Some
important branchcs of the subJect are omitted altogether : others are discussed
with a fulness quite disproportionate to their importance. It is sometimes
difficult to trace the sequence of the remarks ; and digressions and repetitions
appear to abound. Many attempts have been made to remedy this disorder,
but they have had no real basis, and have rarely satisfied any but their pro-
pounders‚ while each suggested reamangement has been declared by later critics
to make matters only worse. It has been too commonly overlooked that probably
Horace intentionally avoided in this as in other Epistles‚ the appearance of a
