slaves were regarded as of little value ε cf. Pers. 6. 773 Mart. 10. 76. 3. 41.

Τ110 chlamys, being a Greek garment, would not naturally be found in large
numbers in a Roman house. 44. tolleret: Roby 1783, S. G. 765;
the subJect is the giver of the show, who had made the request. 46. fal·
Ιηηὺελανθάνει. furibus, ‘pilferers,' whether slaves of the house or
others. 48. repetas, ‘ return with each new day to!

49-55. If the honours of the state are what you desire, then busily canvass
for them. 49. species, ‘ state‚' especially of a magistrate: Tac. Ann. 4. 6 -
sua consulibus, sua praetoribus speeie& gratia, ‘ popularity.’ 50. qui
dictet nomina, the nomenclator, who accompanied a candidate on his
canvass (ambitio), in order to whisper to him the names of voters. cf. Cic.
pro Mur. 36. 77 quid? quod habes nomenclatorem? in eo quidem fallis et de-
cipiS, nam si nomine appellari abs te cives tuos honestan est, turpe est eos
notiores esse servo tuo quam tibi. In 72 B.c. when Cato was standing for the
military tribuneship, the employment of nomenclatores was forbidden by law,
though the law was rarely obeyed. Nine years later it had been repealed
or was regarded as obsoIete, even by Cato. 51. fodicet, ‘’:nudge the
nomenclator ls of course on the outside of the path, his master having the wall
to his right: cf. S. 2. 5. 17. For the action cf. Ter. Hec. 3. 5. 17 La. dic

preters explain of ‘stepping- -'stones placed in the road· thus Comm. Cruq.
pondera lapides qui per vias porriquntur aut (qui per) latera viarum positi
altiores (sunt). Gesner (followed by Lachmann, Haupt, Conington) gives
ultra aequilibrium corporis cum periculo cadendi, ‘at risk of tumbling
down ’3 cf. Ov. Met. 1. 12 nec circumfuso pendebat in aere tellus Ι ponderibus

· librata suis; Lucr. 2. 218, 6. 574; Lucan 1. 57. Orelli takes it

of the weights on the counter of a shop, supporting his interpretation
by the picture of a shop at Pompeii; but is it possible to understand
so important a limiting notion as ‘of the shop’? The first view has
recently been advocated by Τ. Mommsen and Kriiger. Overbeck Pom-

peii3 56 describes the broader streets as having three such stepping-stones ‘

(Fig. 19), the narrower, one. It is admitted that there is no evidence, except
in the scholiasts, that these were called pondera: but their view must have
been based upon some traditional authority. The picture thus suggested is
that of a candidate 111 the cumbrous whitened toga, pressed by his attendant
to hurry across the street in order to shake hands with an influential elector
on the path opposite. The street was usually narrow, in Pompeii never more
than about 24 feet broad, and often only 9 or 10, inclusive of the paths
(maryines), but the latter were as a rule much raised.

52. Fabia: sc. tribu, one of the original country-tribes. Velina, one of
the two added latest, in 241 B.c. 53. hic: sc. a third man. cui dare
libet: the forms of free election were allowed to remain during the time of
Augustus, who himself took part in the canvassing (cf. Suet. Oct. 40 comitiorum
ius pristinum reduxit), and the elections of 19 Β.0. gave rise to serious disturb-
ances: it was only Tiberius who made the sanction of the comitia merely
formal. curule ebur: the sella curulis, a distinction enj0yed by the curule
aedileS, praetors,and consuls. 54. inportunae, ‘making himself awkward,’
cf. S. 2. 5. 96 11. 55. facetus=blande et comiter, ‘politely,’ apparently a
colloquial usage : cf. Ter. Heaut. 3. 2. 10 mulier commoda,saceta haee meretrix.
