‘the ends of the earth! 55. qua . . . ignes. The torrid zone. de-

nothing to control them ; 1. 3. 13 n. 56. qua . . . rores. The frigid zone.
58. hac lege . . . ne, ‘on this condition . . . that (they do) not.’ pii:
pius expresses the dutiful affection of a child for its parents, here that of the
Romans sor their parent city (μητρόπολις). 59. rebUS, ⁶ fortunes!

60. Troiae. Troiae. Cf. 1. 2. 4 n. ‘of Troy, if it rise again with
mournful 81118115, the fortune shall be repeated in grievous disaster.' 61.

ODE IV

‘ Iuspire me, Calliope. Nay methiuks, με Muses, that I am already listeuirzgy
to your voice and wanderiuy amid your hauuts. Y ou by heaveu's favour
specially quarded my infant years. Y ours I shall be ever aud everywhere ,-

peace. (He, so aided, shall rulc the world, aud overthrow all impious rebe-Ilion,
eveu as) we know that Jupiter overthrew the Titane-⁹

An exceedingly skilful Ode, inrwhich, after dwelling on his own career as
the child of the Muses, Horace by an easy transition proceeds to panegyrise
the government of Augustus, the gentleness of which can only 118 due to the
same fostering care, and finally with singular abruptness but singular force
introduces a dramatic account of the defeat of the giants, which at once
suggests the thought how J ove’s great vicegerent on earth shall in like manner
be victorious over his foeS.

1. descende caelo. The Muses dwell in heaven; cf. Hom. Π. 2. 491
Ὀλυμπιάδες Μοῦσαι. Β111 Porphyrion says quod velit. iam trau-sire a Iunonis
sermonibus· dic age . . . ‘come breathe upon the pipe a lengthy lay,
or if thou now dost choose with clear-ringing voice, or with the strings and harp
of Phoebus.' Calfiope is allowed three. choices (tibia—-seu voce acuta———scu
fidibus citharaque), (l) to ‘utter a lay on the pipe‚’ i.e. a lay accompanied by
the pipe, (2) a lay sung without accompaniment, (3) a lay accompanied by the
lyre. If only she will sing, Horace makes no condition as to the manner.
citharave has all MS. authority, hut fides cannot denote ‘the stringe of a· Zyre '
as opposed to a cithara, and the hendiadys (cf. 2. 7. 9 11.) fidibus citharaque
is quite clear, cf. Virg. Aen. 6, 120 fretus cithara fidibusque carioris.
