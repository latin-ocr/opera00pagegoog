ons 11 NOTES 281

for his country dies, Ι Since death pursues the coward as he flies ; Ι The youth
in vain would fly from fate’s attack, Ι With trembling knees and terror at his
back? mori: mors. For this method of joining clauses, cf. 1. 2. 4 11.
Cf. Tyrtaeus‚ fr. 10 τεθνάμεναι ’γὰρ καλὸν ἐνὶ προμάχοισι πεσόντα Ι ἄνδρ’
ἀγαθόν, περὶ ᾗ πατρίδι μαρνάμενον.

17. virtus, from vir, ‘manliness‚' ‘virtue‚’ is here distinct from ‘ courage '
which has already been dealt with 1-16: it is that manly independenc'e and
determination which acts up to the principle ‘That, because right is right, to
follow right Ι Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.’ Such a character
may well be described as ‘ignorant of disgraceful defeat‚' ‘bright with un-
sullied dignitiesss and independent of the shifting ‘breeze of popular favour ' 3
at the same time Horace is influenced in his description by a recollection of
the well-known Stoic paradox that the perfectly virtuous man, however low
his position in life, is nevertheless ‘rich,' ‘noble‚' and ‘king of kings.' Cf. 4.
9. 39 ; S. 1. 3. 136 ; Ep. 1. 1. 107. repulsae sordidae: cf. Ep. 1. 1. 43.
18. honoribus t honor is frequently used for ‘ an office of dignity,' ‘ a magis-
tracy,' cf. 1. 1. 8 11. 19. secures. See Dict. Ant. S.v. fascea and cf. O. S.
54 n. 20. arbitrio, ‘at the decision,' i.e. in obedience to the decision.
The expression popularis aurae explains itself ; cf. Virg. Aen. 6. 816
9α1ιάεηε popularibus auris,· Cic. pro Clu. 47 ventus popularis,

21. virtus . . . ‘virtue opening the gate of heaven for those who have not
deserved to die essays her course along forbidden paths . . .' inmeritis
mori, i.e. those who like Pollux, Hercules and Quirinus (see next Ode, lines 9-
15) have by the nobility of their lives deserved to escape the common doom of
death, and have won for themselves an immortality of renown. 22. caelum.
Of. Virg. Aen. 6. 130 quos . . . ardens evexit ad aethera virtue. negata
via. Although to mortals immortality is forbidden, virtue does notwithstand-
ing discover the way which leads to it. The expression recalls J ob xxviii. 7
‘ There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not
seen.’ 23. udam humum, ‘the damp ground,' i.e.‚ apart from metaph0r‚
the ordinary mean and unworthy objects of human pursuit.

25. est et . . . The difficult connexion between these stanzas and the
preceding ones is indicated in the summary (after Pliiss). Opposed to up-
rightness (vs-irtus) and true reverence for the mysteries of religion (fidele silen-
tium), are profanity (cf. valya‘rit) and crime (incesto, scelestum): the reward of
the one is as sure as the punishment of the other. On the other hand Frie-
drich (Phil. Unt. 154), following Mommsen, considers that Horace is in this
Ode describing the qualities required (1) in military (virtus) and (2) in civil
service (fidele silentium) under the empire; and this line is a fragment of
Simonides ἐστὶ καὶ σιγῆς ἀκίνδυνον γέρας which we know (Plut. Apophth.
Aug. 7) to have been quoted by AugustuS. 26. vetabo, ‘ I will forbid one
who has made public the rites of mystic Ceres to be beneath the same roos-trec
or to launch his bark with me.’ Cereris sacrum. See Dict. Ant. av.
Eleusinia. 28. sit: dependent on vetabo ; cf. volo fiat, sae sis, etc.

29. solvat. Used of undoing the cable which fastenedva ship to the shore.
For the danger of embarking with guilty men cf. Aesch. S. c. Theb. 602 ἢ ’γὰρ
συνεισβὰς πλοῖον εὐσεβὴς ἀνὴρ Ι ναύταισι θερμοῖς καὶ πανουργίᾳ τινὶ Ι ὄλωλεν
ἀνδρῶν σὺν θεοπτύστῳ γένει ; Genesis xviii. 23-33 ‘Wilt thou also destroy the
righteous with the wicked 2 ' Diespiter: an archaic word used to give an
impression of solemnity, cf. l. 34. 5 n. For derivation cf. 1. 1. 25 11.
saepe . . . raro: notice the emphatic position and antithesis of these wordS.
