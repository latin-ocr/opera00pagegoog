erisne xlx NOTES 549

the praetor's edict. edixit has good MS. authority but neither Gratiuus, Ennius,
or Liber fits in as a nom. and it is clear that Horace is ridiculing his own slavish
imitators, cf. line 18. 11. nocturno . . . diurno : this line curiously
resembles in rhythm A. P. 269 nocturna versate marcu, versate dimna. For
certare ef. Od. 4. 1. 31. putere: a stronger word than olere line 5. The
epithet diurno is not quite strictly applied to the wine itself: the meaning is ‘they
stink all day of the wine which they vie with each other in drinking at night.’

12. pede nudo: Plutarch says of Cato of Utica (0. 6) πολλάκις ἀνυπόδητος
καὶ ἀχίτων εἰς τὸ δημόσιον προῄει μετ’ ἄριστον, 31111 111 e. 1 speaks of the firm
and immovable expression of his face. Some think that Horace refers to the
elder Cato, but it is more in harmony with the context to understand a con-
temporary as the object of imitation, than one who had died more than a
century before. Cf. Mommsen, Hist. 4. 156: ‘A strange caricature of his
ancestor . . . he even formed a school, and there were individuals—it is true
they were but a few—who in their turn copied 31111 caricatured afresh the
living pattern of a philosopher.¹ Cic. ad Att. 2. 1. 10 speaks of Servilius as
Catonis aemulator, and often mentions Favonius, who we learn from Dio 38.
7 was called the ‘ ape of Cato! cf. the proverb cucullus riori facit monachum.
13. textore : a kind of instrumental ablative. 15. rupit, ‘ruined’: many
editors suppose that Iarbitas strained himself till he burst, in the attempt to
rival Timagenes in loudness of voice and fluency of speech ; but 11113 13 quite
inconsistent with urbanus. It seems rather that he brought himself into
trouble by imitating the bitter wit of Timagenes. Kru'ger well compares Val.
Flacc. 5. 341 lumina rumpere fletu with Ov. A. A. 1. 129 lacrimis corrumpere
ocellos. Conington’s rendering ‘The wretched Moor, who matched himself in
wit Ι With keen Timagenes, in sunder split ' is based upon the story given by
Acron: cum Timayeoiem philosophum post convivium et inter pocula deela-
mantem vellet imitari et ‘non posset, inmdia quodammodo discerptus est, though
he seems rightly to reject the notion that rupit means simply rupit invidia.
Any notion of envious rivalry seems out of keeping with the next line.
Iarbitam: the Scholiasts say that he was 3 Mauretanian‚ named Cordus—-
possibly the Codrus of Virg. Ecl. 7. 26 invidia rumpantur ut ilia Codro—who
was nicknamed Iarbitas from Iarbas, the king of the Gaetulians who appears
in the Aeneid (4. 196). Timagenes was a rhetorician of Alexandria, brought
as a prisoner to Rome by A. Gabinius in 55 Β.0., 31111 31 first employed as a
cook and 3 litter-bearer, but afterwards ransomed by Faustus Sulla. He
opened a school of rhetoric, and met with much success, acquiring the favour
of Augustus But afterwards he offended the emperor by some bitter jests

upon his wife and family, and was compelled to retire to the estate of Asinius
Pollio at Tusculum. cf. Quintil. 10. 75.

17. vitiis with imitabile, not with decipit, which can well stand alone.
Cf. Juv. 14. 40 quoniam dociles imitandis turpibus ae pravis omnes siamus.
18. pallerem can only mean ‘ if I were pale ' which I am not. Horace
describes himself as sun-burnt in 1. 20. 24. exsangue cuminum: cf.
Plin. H. N. 20. 14. 57 omne (cuminum) pallorem bibentibus yiynit. ita certe
ferunt Porcii Latronis dari inter magistros dicendi assectatores similitudinem
coloris studiis contracti imitatos. exsangue here: ‘causing paleness'
19. servum: Iwc novam ei fortius quam servile—Ritter. ovid has serva manus
(Fast. 6. 558) and serva aqua (Am. 1. 6. 26). 20. bilem, ‘wrath ’3 S. 1. 9.
66 ; 2. 3. 141. tumultus, ‘the coil you make ’—-Con.
