Thrace and wakes to marvel at the strange land. 11. pede barbaro
lustratam, ‘traversed by barbarous feet,' πλε. by the feet of Thracian Bac·
chanals. In Gk. βάρβαρος (611 imitative wordz‘a jabberer') is simply one
who does not speak Greek, a uon-Greek, and the Roman poets imitated this
use, employing the word frequently, as here, with no tinge of contempt, aq.
when Plautus wishes to say he has translated 6 Greek play into Latin he says
Plautus vortit barbare.

14. oNaiadum potens, ‘O Lord of the River-Nymphs.' NazadeszNacda-ss
(νάω ‘to flow‚' νᾶμα. 6 81166111)., 16. vertere, ‘to upturn‚' ‘uproot.' See
Eur. Bach. 1109 for this and other feats of the Bacchanals. 17. humili
modo, ‘in lowly fashion.' 18. dulce . . . ‘a J'oyous hazard is it, Ο
King of the Wine-press‚ to follow the god who garlands . . .' For peri-
culum cf. Il. 20. 131 χαλεποὶ δὲ θεοὶ φαίνεσθαι ἐναργεῖς and Judges xiii. 22
‘And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen
God.’ 19. Lenaeus=AnvaZos from ληνός, ‘ a wine-press.'

ODE XXVI

‘ But Zately I was a successful combatant in the lists of love .· now in token
that ‘my warfare is finished I here dedicated my arms to Venus, with just one
final prayer—that the yoddess will make Chloe pay sor Iter conceitss

It was customary on leaving off any occupation to dedicate some of the
instruments connected with it to an appropriate divinity‚ ay. a gladiator
dedicates his arms (Ep. 1. 1. 4), a fading beauty her mirror (cf. 4. 10. 6 n.)‚ a
slave his chains (S. l. 5. 65), and so here Horace dedicates his lyre and other
imaginary paraphernalia of love-making. Το 811611 dedicated obJects a short
poetical inscription was frequently appended (cf. the many ἀναθηματικά 111
1116 Gk. Anthology), and this Ode is supposed to be written for that obJ‘ect.
Notice the humorous inconsistency between the declaration at the beginning
and the prayer at the conclusion.

1. vixi with nuper, idoneus with puellis. 2. militavi. Cf. bella moves
4. 1. 2, militiae 4. 1. 16, Ov. Am. 1. 9. 1 militat omnis amam. 3. defunc-
tumque . . . ‘ and my lyre whose wars are ended.’ 4. barbiton: βάρβιτον,
cf. 1. 32. 4 n. hic paries . . . Because 1116 lyre would be hung upon
the wall (cf. ἀνάθημα). 5. marinae, ‘sea-born.' Ἀφροδίτη was born from
the foam (ἀφρός) of the sea. Veneris, ‘ (of the temple) of Venus.’

6. lucida funalia: torches made from ropes dipped in tar. He still
keeps up the simile from war in his description of these instruments for 6
‘night assault.’ What would be the use of ‘bows ' to ‘threaten opposing
doors ’ it is difficult to see, nor 18 11 any explanation to say that they were for
‘ threatening the doorkeepers.’ Perhaps by arcus Horace intends some mili-
tary engine (such as the arcuballistd of later times) which was used in sieges
and discharged missiles by means of a huge ‘bow ' : the whole description is
designedly exaggerated. 9. beatam, ‘blessed‚' perhaps ⁴ as being thy
favour-ite seat? 10. Memphin . . . Herod. 2. 112 mentions a temple of
Ξείνη Ἀφροδίτη 61 Memphis. aarentem Sithonia nive, i.e. enjoying a
warm climate. Sithonia was the centra] peninsula 111 Chalcidice, and cf. Virg.
Ecl. 10. 66 Simonias nives, but here the adj. is quite 0111 of place. 11.
sublimi ε pictorial, ‘with uplifted lash.' 12. tange semel : ‘touch ’ and
‘ once ’ by their studjed moderation suggest more than is expressed.
