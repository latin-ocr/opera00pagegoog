racc, that uudefeated by disaster came from Troy to Italy, still, like its ‘native
oak, the more it is lopped the more viqorously it ,qrows .· H ydra-like it only
becomes more formidable aster each defeat. Never again shall I send lime the
proud messaqes of victory. Fallen, fallen all my hopes uow Hasdrubal is

Drusus was the son of Livia, the wife of Augustus, by her former
husband, Tiberius Claudius Nero, and the younger brother of Tiberius
(afterwards Emperor), along with whom he defeated the Rhaeti and
Vindelici ΒΩ. 15. He died. when on an expedition to Germany B.c. 9,
being then consul. He was much more popular than Tiberius ; cf. Tac. Ann.
1. 33 Drusi myria apud populum Romanam memoria, credebaturque, si rerum
potitus foret, libertatem redditurae. See also 4. 14 Int. The Ode is a perfect
model of a Prize Ode, and has long served as such. It exhibits little real
poetic power but great skill in composition, and is the work of invention
rather than inspiration: the elaborate comparison for instance in the first
four stanzas can only have been worked out with immense painS.

1. qualem . . . The construction is: qualem alitem (then follow four
clauses of all of which this is the object) . . . qualemve caprea . . . leonem
. . vidit (talem) videre Drusum Vindelici. The qualem in line 1 is governed
by four verbs propulit, docuere, demisit, and. eyit, the four stages in the
growth of the eagle being marked by the words olim, iam, mox and nuuc.
In translating follow some such outline as these. ‘Like as the bird that
guards the thunderbolt (to which . . .) of old his youth . . ., and presently
. . ., then on the sheepfolds . . ., now at last . . . ; or like the lion which a
hind . . . has seen : so saw the Vindelici Drusus waging war! ministrum
fulminis: cf. Virg. Aen. 5. 255 Iovis armiyer. An eagle grasping a thunder-
bolt is especially frequent on the coins of the Ptolemies. 3. expertus
fidelem in . . . ‘having proved his saith in (the carrying off of) golden-haired
Ganymede,’ whom the eagle carried off from Ida ; cf. Virg. Aen. 5. 254 quem
praepes ab Ida Ι sublimem pedibus rapuit Iovis armiyer uncis. Notice the
careful juxtaposition of rex requam, Iuppiter Ganymede.

5. olim: from ille olle, ‘ at that tiine,’ ‘not at this particular time,’ bears
very various senses according to the connexion in which it is used,=(1) at
some past time, 4. 9. 9 ; (2) at some future time, 2. 10. 17 ; (3) some time or
other. Here in connexion with iam, mox, ‘nuuc it throws the mind back to
that time past when the eagle's career commenced. · patrius vigor, ‘ native
force,' cf. line 30 patrum virtus. The words anticipata the remarks on
hereditary valour which come later. 7. vernique . . . ‘ and soon verna]
breezes when the clouds are banished have taught him timorous (at first)
unwonted efforts.’ Scaliger objected that eaglets being only hatched late in
spring cannot fly till autumn, and proposed 10 write vernis, thus making the
line intolerable. Horace clearly knows nothing about the hatching of young
eagles: he considers that like young lambs and young birds generally they
are among the phenomena of spring. 10. vividus inpetus, ‘ his eager
swoop.' 11. reluctantes. The word is untranslateable. The snake
carried off in the eagle’s talons wrestles (luctatur) with its captor and coils
itself up or back (re) in its endeavours to sting him. Such a scene is fully
described, Virg. Aen. 11. 751 seq. 12. amor dapis atque pugnae, ‘ love
of feast and fray ² : the eagle at first satisfied with preying on a lamb is now
not content without the additional excitement of a contest.
