SATIRE v1 NOTES 415

appears 111 the fact that 110 will not go as far as Tibur (Tivoli‚ 16 miles NE.
of Rome) without a train of slaves : his meanness appears 111 1113 having so few
as five, whereas a praetor, if he had any train with him, should have a hand-
some one: and also in the fact that these slaves carry with them necessary
articles to avoid the expense of putting up at inns. 108. Tiburte : nom.
Tiburs. 109. lasanum, λάσανον, ‘a commode! 111. milibus atque aliis:
parallel to hoc, ‘in this and in thousands of other things.' 113. fallacem
circum: the circus was the haunt of fortune-tellerS‚ astroIogers, 'and such-
like impostors. cf. Cic. de Divin. 1. 58. 132 de circo astrologos ; Juv. 6. 582.
114. adsisto divinis, ‘ I stand beside the fortune-tellerS‚’ who carried 011 3
busy trade with the lower orders in superstitious Rome: cf. dimna, 1. 9. 30.

116. pueris tribus: when an abl. of the agent without a or ab is used,
the circumstances or result, rather than the agent, are called attention to.
Here the fact that the slaves were three 111 number is called attention to 3 but
see Od. l. 6. 1 11. That three was not a large number of slaves to wait at
dinner, we may perhaps infer from 1. 3. 11 habebat saepe ducentos, Ι saepe decem
semvos .· 011 the other hand, it is not meant for a small number. Horace kept
the mean a gentleman should between⁴ ostentation and meanness lapis
albus, a table consisting of a slab of white marble, supported on three legs :
see l. 3. 13 n. 117. pocula duo: a pair of cups are put on the table
because such articles were generally in pairs, cf. Cio.Verr. 2, 2. 19. 47 scyphorum
paria complura. A second clean cup might be wanted for a fresh sort of
wine. cyatho, ‘a ladle,' containing ἠὼ of the sextarius. echinus:
an unknown vessel somewhat in the shape of a ‘ sea-urchin.' ἐχῖνος, χύτρας
εἶδος Erotianus p. 170 ; Pollux 6. 13. 91. 118. cum patera gatus, ‘an
011-11331( with its saucer,' for dropping 011 011 the salad. ,φαίνω is any flask
with a narrow neck for pouring liquidS, especially 011 ραίίαίίᾱηε cf. Gen. 17.
8. 5. It would naturally have a saucer (patera), to prevent drops running
down on the table. Campana supellex, i.e. fictilis} of cheap pottery (cf.
2. 3. 144), not silver.

120. Marsya ε statues of Marsyas, or Silenus, the attendant of Bacchus,
were erected in the market-place of many free towns, as a symbol of liberty.
The statue had the hand uplifted (Serv. on Aen. 4. 58 Marsyas . . . infero
positus libertatis indicium est, qui erecta manu testatur nihil urbi deesse), and
Horace here comically explains the uplifbed hand as a gesture of disgust at the

face of the ounger of the Novii‚ usurers, who carried 011 their business 111
· the Forum iaceo, ‘ I lie until the fourth hour,' not
sleeping3 for though Horace was somni benignus, ,yet he considered sleep to
the first hour as a long night's sleep, Ep. 1. 17. 6; but, after waking and
probably taking his ientawlum, or light breakfast, still lying in bed reading
or meditating ; cf. Ep. 1. 2. 35 posces ante diem librum cum lumine. vagor,
‘ stroll.' lecto and scripto are abl. absolute. Horace after rising either
takes a w‘alk or continues his studies more methodically than he could in his
bed. 123. unguor olivo, preparatory to engaging in athletic 0110101303, 33

the game of ball 3 cf. Od. 1.‹8. 8. 124. Natta, unknown elsewhere, used
lamp 011 to rub himself with, thus cheating his lamps. “

125. lavatum: the usual hour for bathing was the eighth, one hour before
dinner cena (Becker's Gallus p. 396). But Horace's hours seem to have been
differently arranged from those usual in Martial's time. For we find him
taking his bath before luncheon (prandium), probably about one o'clock, while
his ordinary dinner hour seems to have been much later than the ninth hour ;
