that the most sensitive criticism can detect no flaw. If perfectum is read. it is
impossible to account for the much rarer word praesectum having got into our
older authorities.

295-308. This careful polishiny is quite inconsistent urieli the noiion that
poetry is produced in a kind os impio-ed frenzy. I would rather keep mse]
sanity as a critic, and teach others, without attemptinq verse myself. 296.
excludit sanos: cf. S. 2. 3. 322 11. 297. bona pars: just like our ‘a
good part,’ ‘a good many ' ; cf. Od. 4. 2. 46 meae vocis bona pars ; S. 1. 1. 61
bona pars hominum ,· Lucr. 5. 1025 bona maynaque pars ,· so Ter. Eun. 1. 2. 43.
Cicero has it in his dialogues (de Orat. 2. 3. 14), not in his speeches. It
seems a somewhat colloquial usage. non ungues ponere, i. e. neglects
personal appearance ; cf. Ep. 1. 7. 50 n., and Tatian's description of the
Cynics (adv. Graecos p. 87) κόμην ἐπιειμένοι πωγωνοτροφοῦσιν ὄνυχας θηρίων

mark of a philosopher (cf. S. 2. 3. 35 sapientem pascere barbam), but allowed to
grow by all who were careless of their appearance. The public baths were great
centres for social reunion. 299. nanciscetur, the subJect is ‘ a man,' any
one of the ‘ good many ' just mentioned. 300. Anticyris for Anticyra
in PhociS, cf. S. 2. 3. 82 n. There was another Anticyra on the Spercheius at
the head of the Maliac Gulf, and attempts have even been made to find a
third, but Horace clearly means ‘ any number of Anticyras,’ Just as we might
say ‘ten Karlsbads would 1101 cure you.' 301. tonsori Licino z an unknown
barber. There is 110 reason for identifying him, as the scholiasts do, with the
famous Licinus who was a Gaul, taken prisoner by Caesar, and made his dis·
pensator. He was afterwards emancipated and high in favour with Augustus,
who made him procurator of Gaul in 16 and 15 Β.0. There he acquired great
wealth‚ which became proverbial: cf. Pers. 2. 36 ; Juv. 1. 109 690 possideo
plus Pallante et [sicini3; 14. 305 praedives [sicinae. On him was written the
excellent epigram quoted here by the scholiasts: marmoreo tumulo Licinus
iacet, at G'ato nullo, Ι Pompeius parvo: quis putet esse deos?

301. o ego laevus, ‘how stupid I am ’ 3 Ιαθνυεεσκαιός, cf. Virg. Aen.
2. 54 si mens non laeva fiaisset. 302. purgor bilem: the verb is here
used strictly in a middle sense, like καθαίρομαι, ‘ get rid of my bile ' 3 cf. Roby
1102, 1126-7‚ S. G. 462, 471. sub . . . horam, ‘as the season of spring
comes on' ; cf. Od. 1. 18. 14 11. 0618118 2. 13 says that hellebore, which was
a strong purgative, is best taken in spring ; and Porph. here has omnes verno
tempore purgationem sumunt, quod vocatur καθαρτικόν. 303. faceret,
i.e. if I did not keep my head clear by taking a purgative in spring. 304.
nil tanti est, ‘ nothing is worth such a cost‚’ i. e. even the reputation of a
poet is not worth the loss of one's reason: the phrase is like our ‘it’s not good
enough,' or Ze Jea ne ‘aaut pas Za ohandelle. cotis: so Isocrates, when
asked why he taught others to speak but never spoke himself, replied καὶ αἱ
ἀκόναι αὐταὶ μὲν τεμεῖν οὐ δύνανται, τὸν δὲ σίδηρον ὀξέα, καὶ τμητικὸν ποιοῦσιν
(ps.-Plut. Vit. X Orat. 4). 306. munus et officium: sc. scribendi, to
be understood from nil scribens: of the two words officium is the stronger,
as carrying with it the idea of moral obligation. 307. opes, ‘stores ' of
material: formet, ‘moulds’; cf. lines 108, 1263 Ep. 2. 1. 128. 308.
virtus, i.e. a true knowledge of the canons of the poetic art ε ἀρετή.
