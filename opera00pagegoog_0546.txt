his language at onoc to the elevated tastes and the reserved temper of Tiberius.

EPISTLE X

Aristius Fuscus was an intimate friend of Horace, addressed by him in od.
1. 22, ancl mentioned also S. 1. 9. 61 ; 10. 83, ain 1110 former case as playing a
mischievous J'oke upon him, in the latter among other friends as optimus.
Some MSS. here have the heading Ad Aristium Fuscum Grammaticum, and
Acron on S. 1. 9. 61 says hic ficit yrammaticus illius temporis doctissimus: here
he says he was a writer of tragedies, while Porphyrion calls him a writer of
comedies. It 13 clear that he was a literary man, and from this epistle it
appears that he did 1101 share Horace’s love for the country and its pursuits.

1«11. G'reetinq to my friend Fuscus, 30 like me in everythfflq, except that he
is a lover of the town, I of the country,· for I can now only enioy a simple life.
1. iubemus, plural for the singular, as so commonly in Cicero: it 13 1033
common to have a plural substantive: but cf. Cic. ad Att. 1. 1. 2 eaeeurremus
