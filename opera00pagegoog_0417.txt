sATIRE 111 NOTES 389

κανηφόροι, 01· ⁵ basket-bearers,' maidens who at various Greek religious fest1vals
(aq. of Demeter, Dionysus, and Athena) carried the sacred things on their
headS. Their gait would be slow and solemn3 cf. 2. 8. 14. 12. decem:
ten slaves seems a large number to us, but it was about the smallest number
which, consistent with respectability‚ a Roman gentleman could have. Horace
had eight on his farm, 2. 7. 118 ; three served his dinner‚ 1. 6. 116. reges
atque tetrarcha-S, ‘ kings aud pashas.' The most notable tetrarchies were
those of Galatia and of Judaea. 13. mensa tripes: the earliest and
simplest kind with three legs : the more fashionable kind at this period and
later had only one central leg of ivory or bronze. rPhe three-legged tables
were sometimes called Delphicae from their resemblance to the trip0d; cf.
Mart. 12. 66. 7 aurum non simplem Delphica portat. 14. concha. In-
stead of the silver salt-cellar, usual even in humble households (Od. 2. 16. 14),
113 would be content with a shell of salt, and the salt would be sufficient
condiment for his food, cf. 2. 2. 17.

15. deciens centena (milia sestertium), ‘ a 1111111011 333131333,’ about ..4:8000.
dedisses: for si dedisses ,· but si is often omitted in putting hypothetical
cases, cf. 1. 1. 45, and the case is put somewhat more strongly than if si were
used: ‘ suppose you gave.' 17 . erat, ‘there was sure to be nothing.' 18.
nil: more comprehensive than nemo. We scarcely have this idiom in English,
but it is common in Latin 3 cf. Nep. Alcib. 1 constat . . . m'lzil illo fuisse ea:-
cellenlius vel in vitiis vel in virtutibus. 19. quid tu. Horace makes this
retort the link to connect his exordium with his chief subJ‘ect, viz. the duty
of being gentle towards the failings of our friends. 20. immo alia, ‘ ay,
I have, but different from these, and perhaps of a lesser kind.’ imvm is used
like ’γε 111 answers where something more than an affirmative is given : it also
has the force of μὲν οὖν, corrective ; ‘nay.’ It combines both meanings here,
‘yes, but.' minora: cf. 1. 4. 1303 6. 65.

21. Maenius: 1. 1. 101 n. Novium: possibly one of the Novii,
usurers mentioned 1. 6. 121. carperet, ‘was running down.' heus tu :
οὗτος (voc.), ⁴ hark you, sir l ' 22. dare verba: to give words (for things),
hence to caj01e‚ deceive. Note the play on sound of immas, igynotum, 19110300.-
cf. inqenium inqens line 33. 23. putas, ⁴ do you think you are deceiving
us as a strangerZ' not ‘do you think to,’ raze. ‘expect ' (δοκεῖς), a use which
puto does not seem to have. 24. inprobus, ‘brazen,’ ‘impudent': see

line 56 n. dignusque notari, ‘ deserving of censure ’; for the inf. cf. Od.
1. 3. 25 n. The Augustan poets do not use the common prose construction of
dignus with relative. 25. pervideas, ‘ examine.’ mala, ‘faults 'z cf.
Ep. 2. 2. 127 ; Phaedr. 4. 10. 4 hac re videre nostra mala ‘non possumus: Ι

alii simul delinquunt censores sumus. inunctis: cf. lippus inunyui Ep. 1.
1. 29. Your eyes are rheumy, and covered with eye-salve, when you survey
your own faults. 26. in, ‘in the case of.’ 27. aquila: cf. Hom. 11.
17. 674 αἰετὸς ὄν ῥά τέ φασιν Ι ὀξύτατον δέρκεσθαι ὑπουρανίων πετεηνῶν.
serpens Epidaurius: all serpents were considered sharp-sighted (δράκων,
δέρκομαι). They were sacred to Aesculapius who was worshipped in the form
of a serpent at Epidaurus, and. a serpent, believed to be the god himself, was
brought thence to Rome to heal a pestilence, 293 Β. 0. Τ1113 serpent made its
way to the island in the Tiber, and a temple to Aesculapius was built there.

29. iracundior: Acron and Schol. Cruq. say that Hor. refers to Virgil
here. He is ‚probably not referring to any particular individual, although he
mixes up many of his own traits in the picture: he was hot-tempered, 2. 3.
