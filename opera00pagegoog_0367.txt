{guldhnaturssllyf'b} watched for in connexion with this solemn ceremony.
. a 'tet . . n. ·

25. doctor . . . ‘thou who didst teach clear-voiced Thalia to play
upon the 1ute.’ Kennedy, virg. Ecl. 6. 1, has an excellent note on aryutus.
⁶ Originally the part. pass of aryuo, to prove, make clear or distinct; as an
adj. it is largely used in Latin of things which convey a clear, distinct, sharp
perception to the eye, the ear, the smell 01· the mind ; and thus it assumes many
shades of meaning (“fine,'' “clear‚” “minute,'' “sharp,'' “s11rewd,” “melodi-
ous,” “ noisy '')‚ and is found as an attribute to eaput, oc‘wlu3,forum, nemus, ilem,
fistula, servus, etc.’ 26. qui Xantho . . . The line calls attention to
the personal characteristics of the god of poetry 3 cf. 3. 4. 61. Η18 long locks
mark the bar-d, the beardless chin (levis) his undying youth. Xanthus is' in
Lycia. 27. Dauniae decus Camenae, i.e. me, Horace. For Dauniae,
‘Italian,' cf. 2. 1. 34 n. Camenae: note that Horace here uses the native
Italian word, not the foreign and borrowed Musa (Μοῦσα), cf. 1. 12. 39 11.
28. levis, ‘beardless,' as 2. 11. 6: for derivation see 1. 2. 38 n. Agyieu:

’ . a Gk. name for Apollo as god of streets, ἀγυιαῖς Horace seems to select the

word merely to convey a vague feeling of awe and mystery. 29. spiritum,
‘inspiration ' (cf. 2. 16. 38 11.), opposed to artem, ‘technical skill.’ 31.
virginum primae, ‘ye flower (lit. ‘first ’) of maidens ' 3 see Intr.

33. tutela: usually ‘a taking charge of‚' but here=‘ those taken charge
of‚’ in apposition with viryinum primae puerique ‘ ye who are under the pro-
tection.’ 34. cohibentis arcu, ‘who arrests with her bow the swift-
footed . . .’ 35. Lesbium pedem, ‘ mark the Lesbian measure,’ i. e. the
Sapphic metre, cf. 1. 1. 34 11. 36. ictum, ‘beat‚' i.e. as 118 marks the time.

38. crescentem face ε lit. ‘ growing with her torch,' i.e. ‘ with her grow-
ing light.’ Noctilucam, ‘ the night-shining one,' is only found here and
in a passage of Varro. It is probably an old ceremonial word, and introduced
to give archaic solemnity (see 1. 34. 5 n.). Such descriptive words are natural
and commonly found only in very early writers, ey. Hesiod has φερέοικος ‘a
snail,' ἀνόστεος ‘a cuttle-fish,' πέντοζος ‘the hand,’ etc. 39. prosperam
frugum, ‘ prolific in crops,' cf. 3. 6. 17 11. celeremque . . . ‘and
swift to roll the quickly-moving months.' For the inf. cf. 1. 3. 25 n. 41.
nupta iam . . . ‘ soon when a bride you will say! dis amicum
with carmen. 42. saeculo: see Intr. referente, ‘ bringing round?
43. reddidi, ‘ performed'3 you are said reddere when you at the proper time
duly reproduce that which has been taught you. docilis modorum,
‘trained in the measures ’ 3 for gen. cf. 1. 15. 24 n. 44. Horati: 1. 6. 12 11.

ODE VII

‘ The snow has meltedand spriny is retwrniny. The sea-sons in their rcipid
suecession continually remind us os the shortness of Zffe. Only whereas they
return ayain, whereas the waniny moon soon recovers her fuZne38, we when
once we join the rank-s Qf the departed are but dust and a shadow. Who
knows whether he will be alive to-morrow? Enjoy yoursels therefore ; when
once dead neither birth nor merit nor piety can briny you back to life. Diana
has not the power to set Hippolytus free from death, nor Meus Pirithous.²

The Ode is similar to 1. 4 but more serioue. Ep. 1. 5 is also dedicated to
TorquatuS, and Porphyrion (Ep. 1. 5. 9) states that in his time a speech of his
in defence of Moschus (cf. facundia line 23) was still studied.
