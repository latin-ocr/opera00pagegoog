544 HORAOE BOOK 1

between βωμολοχία ‘buffoonery ² and ἀγροικία, the ‘boorishness ' which is
deficient as regards τὸ ἡδὺ τὸ ἐν παιδιᾷ. For the history of the word, and
the stages by which it reaches the bad meaning found Eph. v. 3, 4 (μηδὲ
ὀνομαζέσθω ἐν ὑμῖν . . . μωρολογία ἢ εὐτραπελία [‘Jesting' R. V.]‚ τὰ οὐκ
ἀνήκοντα) see Trench, Synonyms, p. 118, where he says J’ustly ‘there is cer-
tainly nothing particularly amiable in the story which Horace here tells.’
cuicumque : si cui. 32. beatus, etc„ haec coquebat vel dicere
solebat Eutrapelus—Schol. 34. in lucem: cf. 1. 17. 6. honestum
officium: not, as in 1. 17. 21, of the attentions due to his patron, though
some take it SO, but more generally. 35. nummos alienos pascet, ‘he
will let his debts grow,’ especially by ἀνατοκισμός, the interest due being
added to the principal‚ as often now by usurers renewing bills. ad imum,
‘ finally,' when he has sunk to the lowest point. 36. Thraex erit, i. e. he
will turn gladiator, the last resource of the fast young Roman nobleman : cf.

Juv. 11. 1-23. Many MSS. spell Thrax.

37-38. Do not be inquisitiva, but keep secrete entrusted to you. 37.
illius: MS. authority is strong for ulliae, which Bentley first rejected as out
of place here; it is evidently only due to a false assimilation to unquam.
illius refers to the potens (line 44) and venerandus (line 73) cronicae, whoever
he may have been, who appears as ille in line 40. The counsel here given is
nearly identical with that of lines 62-71, and comes in with a certain abrupt-
ness after what has been said of the extravagant and sels-indulgent dependent.
Hence Lehrs places lines 72-75 immediately after line 36, a course which makes
the connexion more natural, and supplies in dominus a natural reference for
illius. Schiitz‚ accepting this, further places lines 69- 71 after line 38, and
thereby brings line 68 into very suitable Juxtaposition with line 76. 38.
tortus, ‘'racked z cf. Od. 3. 21. 13. ira. the irritation felt by Lollius, if
ever his patron treated him with harshness or inJustice. Some explain of
angry threats used to make him disclose the secret.

39-66. Do not obtrude your own pursuits, or disparaye aoid avoid those of
your patron. You are well able to distinquish your-sels in hunting] or the
yames. 39. aliena, here those of the patron. 41. Amphionis: Euri-

· pides in his Antiope introduced Amphion and ZethuS, the two sons of Antiope,

as at variance 011 the value of music, and in an extant fragment (188 Dind.)
Zethus remonstrates with his brother: ἀλλ’ ἐμοὶ πιθοῦ· Ι παῦσαι μελῳδῶν,
πολεμίων δ’ εὐμουσίαν Ι darec· τοιαῦτ’ ἄειδε καὶ δόξεις φρονεῖν, Ι σκάπτων,
ἀρῶν Ὑῆν, ποιμνίοις ἐπιστατῶν, Ι ἄλλοις τὰ κομψὰ ταῦτ’ ἀφεὶς σοφίσματα, Ι
ἐξ ων κενοῖσιν ἐγκατοικήσεις δόμοις. The story was familiar to Roman readers
from the Antiopa of Pacuvius, perhaps the most famous and admired of his
plays. gratia . . . dissiluit, ‘the friendship was severed.' 42. sus·
pecta, as leading to effeminacy. severo: Prop. 4. (3.) 15. 29 et durum
Zethum et lacrimis Amphiona mollem.

46. Aetolis: a ‘literary ’ epithet, recalling the famous Calydonian hunt.
For the significance of such epithets cf. Sellar's Virgil 235 seq. Aeoliis, found
in an inferior MS„ has been adopted by some. It is explained as a reference
to the very fine but strong nets made of the flax grown near Cumae (Plin.
H. N. 19. 1. lO), a colony from Cyme in Aeolia. But such a far-fetched
reference seems impossible. 47. inhumanae, ‘discourteous,' not as a
perpetual epithet, but only under the circumstances. senium, ‘ gloom ' or
‘moroseness ' ε cf. Pers. 1. 26 en pallor seniumque! of poets ; Sen. Hipp. 917
morum senium triste. In Epod. 13. 5 semotus is used in J'ust the same way.
