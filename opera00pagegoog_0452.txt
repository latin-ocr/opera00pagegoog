one. pnlchrezbene is common in Plautus and Terence; it belonged to the
‘language of talk? nosset, not norat, is used here, because there is an ,
implied reason why Horace was glad of the meeting with Fuscus t he was in
the first place mihi caras ; secondly, he knew the character of the bore : hence
Horace expected he would help him to get rid of him. unde venis et quo

69. tricensima sabbata : probably there was no such Jewish festival or

fast ; and Fuscus knew there was not, but invented it for the occasion. The

Jewish sabbath is often referred to by Roman poets ; Ov. A. A. 1. 76 cultaque

Iudaeo septima saera Syro ,· Juv. 14. 96 qnidam sortiti metuentem sabbata

patrem. Other explanations make tricensima sabbata to be either, (l) the feast

of trumpets 3 or (2) the day of atonement 3 or (3) the feast of tabernacles‚

which fell on the lst, 10111, and 15th of the 7th Jewish month, respectively‚

Levit. xxiii. 24, 27, 34 ; either of which may be by different computations

exist! made out to be the 30th sabbath from the beginning of the J ewish year.

licet antestari, ‘ may Ι have you as a witness to the arrest ’ζ’ A fragment
of the XII Tables has 51 IN ivs vooAr NI ir ANTESTATOR Ierrva EM OAPITO :
‘if he summons a party into court, and he refuses to go, let him appeal to a
witness and forthwith seize him.' The word is probably from ante and testor.
lieet antestari? was the regular question put to a bystander to know whether
he would be willing to become a witness to the seiznre. In case he assented‚
the prosecutor touched the tip of his ear. The ceremony existed without
