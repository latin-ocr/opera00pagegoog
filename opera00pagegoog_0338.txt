310 HORACE Book 111

to drink wine almost neat, a practice which the Romans and Greeks con-
sidered as barbarous as we should think it to drink dry brandy.

14. attonitus vates, ‘ a frenzied bard.' For Bacchus in connexion with
poetic inspiration see 2. 19. 6 n. 16. rixarum metuens: cf. 3. 24. 22
metuens alterius viri, ‘fearful of' ; S. 2. 2. 110. This gen. is very common
with pres. participles used adJeetive1y‚ e.g. patiens (1. 8. 4), sciens (1. 15. 24 n.)‚
antuus, appetens. 18. insanire iuvat, ‘it is our pleasure to hold mad
revel ’ 3 for connexion of thought see Summary. Berecyntiae tibiae:
Berecyntus was a mountain in Phrygia on which Cybele was worshipped ; in
her orgiastic rites‚ which were well known at Rome, the exciting music of the
pipe was especially used, cf. 1. 18. 13 n. and 4. 1. 22. 20. pendet,
‘hangs,’ i.e. idle, on its peg.

21. ego: emphatic in opposition to invidus Lycus. 22. rosas: in
winter, an extravagance. audiat . . . ‘let the churl Lycus (λύκος) hear
our mad uproar.’ 24. et vicina . . . ‘and our fair neighbour ill-fitted

for aged Lycus? It would seem that Lycus had a wife or mistress who was
young and pretty, and who, Horace suggests, will be as much amused to
overhear them as Lycus will be annoyed. 25. spissa . . . ‘thee bright
with clustering locks, thee Telephus beautiful as the pure star of evening.'
Note the repetition of Lycus . . . Lyco to express contempt, and of te . . .
te to express admiration. 27. tempestiva: lit. ‘ seasonable,' cle. suited
to you by her youth and charms. 28. lentus, ‘ slow-consuming,' cf. 1. 13. 8.

ODE XX

To Pyrrhus who had carried off the beautiful Nearchus from his love.

‘ Pyrrhus, you are carryiny off her cubs from a licuess. Soon will she
come in pursuit aud the combat over the prcy be sterce. Meautimc he, for
whose sake you both make ready to battle, stands carelessly by indifferent to
everythiuy but his oum beauty?

3. post paulo: commonly paulo post, ‘after by a little,' ‘very soon!
5. cum . . . Nearchum. N otice the simplicity and strength of these two
lines, expressive of the ease and power with which she advances. 7. grande
certamen: accusative in apposition to the sentence, ‘ she comes to recover
Nearchus, (a coming which involves or is identical with) a mighty combat.'
Of. Virg. Aen. 6. 223 pars inyeuti subiere feretro, triste ministerium ‘ some
supported the bier—sad office' ; and often in Greek, ay. Ἑλένην κτάνωμεν,
Μενελέῳ λύπην πικράν, ‘let us kill Helen, (a killing which will be) a bitter
grief to Menelaus.' grande . . . ‘ a mighty contest whether the prize
fall to thee rather or to her.' utrum is to be supplied before tibi. cedere
>with dat. has very commonly the sense of ‘ coming into a person’s possession,'
‘falling to his share.' maior is used somewhat loosely, but perfectly
clearly ; the literal rendering ‘ whether more of the prize pass to thee or her '
is of course impossible. Peerlkamp's maior απ illaz‘or she be superior,'
though generally accepted, makes the stanza end with a very weak and awkward
clause while giving a very unusual sense to Μαίον’.

9. interim, dum tu . . . haec: dum goes with both the contrasted
clauses tu promis and haec acuit, fertur being the main verb. In Latin (cf.
1. 25. 19 n.) contrasted clauses being simply put side by side often cause
difficulty to beginners, though here the contrast is made comparatively clear
by the addition of the pronouns tu, kaec3 in Gk. it would be still clearer
