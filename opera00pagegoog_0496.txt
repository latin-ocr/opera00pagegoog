foret spes mihi certa fuit; Cic. Lael. 19. 68 novitates (amicitiae) si speon
afferunt ut tanquam in herbis non fallacibus fructus appareant, non sunt illae
quidem repudiandae. secundus 110103, or substitutae, was an heir
named in 0330 the first heir declines] the inheritanee, or was in any way dis-
qualified, or died before entering on it, or in his minority, as here. 49.
egerit Orco: 01. the Homeric ”Αιδι προϊάψαι. 50. vacuum: a legal

word for property left without an owner by death. alea and casus
perhaps emphatic.

53. sic . . . ut quah'fies a command, Ps.-0vid. Her. 19. 182 sic facito

spernas, ut vereare, fretum. limis: sc. oculie‘, with a side-glanae: Ter.

4. 6. 2. quid. prima secundo cera velit veram, ‘what the first

page says in the second line.' Wills were generally written on cerae, waxen
tablets ; there were often several 01 these : in the first line of the first of these
the testator’s name was generally written 3 in the second line generally the name
01 1113 heir. solus=here3 ex asse. 55. In order to inculcate the neces-
sity 01 great caution in the profession 01 will-hunting, Tiresias, in oracular
style, predicts an event which had probably actually happened at Rome in
Horace's own day. One Nasica, who had a tall daughter, gave her in marriage
to a rich old man, Coranus, expecting to be remembered in his will. But his
object was too transparent: Coranus made his will indeed, but left his father-
in—law and wife nothing. recoctus scriba ex quinqueviro, ‘ the police
magistrate turned treasury-clerk.' The quinqueviri seem to have been deputy
magistrates, the assistants to the tresviri capitatae, or police magistrates.
They are mentioned by 010. (Acad. Pr. 2. 44. 136) 33 the lowest rank 01
dignitaries, but what the position 01 3 quinquevir compared with a scriba (101·
whom see 2. 6. 36 n.) was, is not clear. Coranus had been a quinquevir;
but he took up the profession 01 3 scriba afterwards. For ecc quinqueviro,
after being a quinquevir (a common idiom 111 Greek, like τυφλὸς ἐκ δεδορκότος,
ἐλεύθερος ἐκ δούλου), 01. 010. Part. 17. 57 ex beato misem Plaut. Rud. 2. 6.
34 te ex insulso salsum feci. recoctus scriba, ‘turned into a notary'
recoquere is to fashion anything anew, and apply it to a different use from its
original one. Others explain here ‘rejuvenated' 3 01. Catull. 54. 5 tibi et
Fuficio seni recocto, where he probably refers to the fable of the daughters of
Pelias boiling their father to give him back his youth. corvum . . .

hiantem: an allusion here to the fable 01 the fox and the crow with the
cheese, Phaedr. 1. 13.

58. furis, ἐνθουσιάζεις : opposed to deliberate (prudens) fooling. 59.
quidquid dicam, aut erit aut non: intentionally ambiguous, after the
manner 01 eracles. 62. tempore quo . . . ε 0130103 often began by
fixing the date by a circumlocution: Herod. 1. 55 ἀλλ’ ὅταν ἡμίονος βασιλεὺς
Μήδοισι Ὑένηταιε Arist. Eq. 197. iuvenis Parthis horrendus: this
gives no near indication 01 the date ; for Augustus might have been so spoken
of any time from the battle of Actium in 31 B.c. until the restoration os the
standards 01 Crassus in 20. alto: 01. Gaesarem altumVOd. 3. 4. 37 3 but
the accessory idea 01 ancient is in the word here : 01. Virg. Aen. 6. 500 qenus
alto a sanquine Teucri ,· Scott‚ Lord 01 the Isles, has, ‘ Of Hereford’s hiqli
blood he came.' 63. demissum: Virg. Aen. l. 288 Iulius a maqno de-
missum nomen Iulo. genus, ⁶ a descendant,' 1. 6. 12 Valeri qenus : so
γένος 13 often used 01 3 single person. 64. forti, ‘gallant ' ; also applied
to 3 bridegroom: here 01 course ironically. 65.. metuentis reddere
