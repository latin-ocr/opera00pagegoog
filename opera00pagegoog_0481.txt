ἀπέχειν χεῖρας. 203. uxore: his concubine Tecmessa. nato: his
little son Eurysaces. 204. non ille: cf. Od. 4. 9. 51 ε non ille is, in
such cases, strongly emphatic, contrasting the conduct of one person with what
that of others might have been under the same circumstances, Teucrum,
half-brother of Ajax, who, on his return to Salamis, was banished by his
father Telamon for not avenging AJ'ax, and founded Salamis in Cyprus; cf.
Od. 1. 7. 21 seq.

205. haerentes Ι with simpl. abl. is without example. It generally takes
dat. or abl. within. Schiitz compares reliyarat udo Ι litore navem od. 1. 32. 7.

reality( κατ’ αὐτὸ τό ὕπαρχον) 01· (2) not in accordance (alias veris). tumultus
= ταραχή, that unphflosophic perturbation which leads to crime. Bentley, who
read veri with some MSS. printed thus: qui species alias, veri scelerisque
tumultu permixtas, and took alias by itself to be equivalent to alias vem's:
‘ false,' which it cannot be. Το take alias veri=alias veriS, ‘ averse from truth,’
is also more than doubtful Latin. 211. desipit: for the hyperbaton cf.
2. 1. 60 11. 212. prudenS, ‘ deliberate1y‚' ἑκών. ob titulos inanes,

furiosum itemque prodigum, cui bonis interdictum est, in curatione iubet esse
aquatorum. 218. abeat tutela, ‘his guardianship would pass to his sane
relations‚' or ‘he would be handed over as a charge to,' for tutela has this
meaning: Od. 4. 6. 33 ; Prop. 4. 8. 3 ; Ov. Trist. 1. 10. 1. abeat is rather
in favour of the second explanation ; cf. line 246. 220. integer animi τ
cf. line 65. 222. et=etiam, ‘as we11.' fiiriosus, ‘raving mad! vitrea,
‘ glassy,’ perhaps combining both the glitter and brittleness of glass. Publil.
Syr. Sent. 171 fortuna vitrea est .· tum cum splendet frangitur. 223. cir-
cum tonuit, ‘thunders around,' and so renders ἐμβρόντητος, the strongest
word to express the idea of insanity. Note the climax: insanus, furiosus

Bellona lacertis Ι saeva movet cecinere deos ,· crinemque rotantes Ι sanquineum
populis ulularunt tristia Galli.
