exsuryil mensa lucernis ,· Ov. A. A. 3. 764. Pentheus under the influence of
Bacchus sees two suns and a double Thebes, Eur. Bacch. 918. 26.
Εν811 twins like Castor and Pollux follow divers pursuits : Il. 3. 237 Κάστορά

θ’ ἱππόδαμον καὶ πὺξ ἀγαθὸν Πολυδεύκεα. 27. Pers, 5. 52 mille hominurn
species et rerum discolor usu3,· Ι velle suum cuique est, nec volo vivitur uno ;
Ter. Phorm. 2. 4. 14 quot homines lot sententiae. 29. nostrum melioris

utroque : a great compliment to Lucilius ; not only his poetical faculty but
his high social position is referred to : cf. 11118 75.

30. sodalibus: so Southey of his Books: ‘My never-failing friends are
they, 1 With whom I converse day by day.' 31. cesseratzevenerat, ‘ if
matters had gone ill with him.’ cedit is sometimes impersonal like procedit,
especially with bene, male, etc.‚ cf. Ov. Met. 10. 80 seu quod ‘male cesserat illi.
33. votiva . . . tabella: sailors saved from shipwreck often hung pictures
of the storm in a temple3 cf. Od. 1. 5. 143 Cic. Nat. Deor. 3. 37. 89 ; Juv.
12. 26 pars dira quidem, sed coynita mullis, Ι et quarn votiva testantur sana
tabella 1 plurima : pictores quis nescit ab Iside pasci? 34. senis: prob-
ably literally and not because Lucih'us belonged to ancient times (cf. 1. 10. 67
poetarum seniorum). J erome, in the chronicle of Eusebius, says that he died
in 103 Β.0. aged 46, but Haupt and L. Muller show that he was born in 180
B.0., Jerome confusing the consuls of that year, A. Postumius and C. Cal-
purnius, with Sp. Postumius and L. Calpurnius who were consuls 111 148 B.0.

34. anceps: masc„ cf. Liv. 31.12 incertus infans natus waasculus an femina
esset, not ‘I am uncertain‚' but ‘a man about whom men may be uncertain,'
etc. Some take anceps as neuter, like Liv. 31. 41 clauserant portas, incertum
vi an voluntate. But anceps est is not used impersonally, like incertum and
dubium. 35. sub, ‘ close to,' ‘up to.' Venusia was colonised 291 B.c. 36.
ad. hoc . . . quo ne . . . ‘for this purpose . . . that thereby (quw-z ut eo)
the foe might not . . .' Palmer objects *to this use of quo ne as unparalleled‚
and renders ‘ To the intent that the foe might not break in on Roman territory
through a space unguarded by him‚' i.e. by the Venusian colonu3‚ joining quo
vacuum together3 cf. Ov. Met. 7. 653 vacuos cultoribus ayros. 37. Romano:
collective for Romania as Epod. 7. 6; cf. Venusinus line 35. 38. quod:

aliquod, agreeing with bellum. 39. incuteret, ‘threatened '; incutere
regularly j0ined with melum, formidinem, etc.‚ the metaphor being taken from
shaking a whip at a person. stilus: there is an allusion to the double

sense of stilus—(1) a dagger‚ (2) a pen. Cic. Phil. 2. 14. 34 et si meus stilus
ille fuisset, ul dicitur, . . . non solum unum actum sed lolam fabulam confecissem ,-

Cic. Cluent. 44. 123. ultro, ‘unprovoked' 3 cf. 2. 7. 40 ; Od. 4. 4. 51 n.
42. tutus, ‘so long as I am unassailed‚' like sanum 1. 6. 89.

43. Iuppiter, ut pereat . . . telum: both in form and sentiment
directly imitated from Catullus 66. 48 Iuppiter ul Chalybon (nation of 811881-
workers) omne yenus pereat, who there translates Callimachus Ζεῦ πάτερ,
ὡς Χαλύβων πᾶν ἀπόλοιτο γένος. nez-utinam. positum, ‘laid aside,'
disused. 45. melius non tangere, clamo: parenthetical. ‘ Let sleeping
dogs lie ' is my advice. 46. flebit, οἰμώξεται, κλαύσεται. cantabitur,
i. e. his name shall be bandied from mouth to mouth, as men repeat my
satire on him ; cf. Aesch. Sept. c. Τ. 7 ὑμνοῖθ’ ὑπ’ ἀστῶν φροιμίοις πολυρρόθοις.

47. Cervius, an informer (quadruplator), 01 rabula, i.e. a low causidicus,
given to dragging people into court. urnam ε the judge’s 11111, 111 which the
voting tablets were put. 48. Canidia, Epod. 5 Intr. Albuci goes with
