he is half J'esting is clear from the ironica] use of the diminutive parmula, ‘ my
poor shield.' ‘mm bene is also used in jest=‘n0t over bravely’: in serious

15 probably induced to tell this tale against himself by the fact that he is
imitating the example of Alcaeus, Archilochus, and Anacreon (V. Orelli). For
the disgrace of throwing away 1116 shield cf. ῥίψασπις and the Spartan 111011161’5
advice to her son, ‘Return either with your shield or upon it.’ 11.
cum . . . mente. The description in these lines is sober earnest‚ all the
more telling preceded and followed as 11 15 by ironica] J‘esting. minaces . . .
‘ those but late so threatening touched with their chin the disgraceful dust.’
The solum is called impe, because when they ⁶ bit the dust ' they were defeated,
an'd to a certain extent all defeat is disgraceful. Most editors take tetigere
mento as referring to the abject prostration of suppliantS, with their faces
in the dust‚ rather than as a reproduction of phrases such as ὀδὰξ λαζοίατο
’γαῖαν Ηο111. 11. 2. 418. They quote Appian 4.131 to prove that certain
leaders did, after the battle,‘ come as suppliants' (ἱκέται προσῄεσαν) 10
Antony. But this is really too recondite and unimportant. What Horace
wishes to do is not to commemorate the cowardly behaviour of his fellow-
soldiers after the battle—to do which would be at once unpoetical and
ungenerous—-but to tell us in five thrilling words how in that fierce fight
those ‘ grim warriors bit the dust.’

13. sed me . . . te: ἀλλ’ ἐμὲ μὲν . . . σὲ δέ ; sed contrasts the divergence
of their after-fortunes with their previous union in danger, cf. the emphatic
tecum at the beginning of the preceding stanza. Mercurius: as the
special patron of poets, cf. 1. 10. 1 n. 14. denso aere: ἠέρι πολλῇ, ‘ in
a thick cloud.' aer is constantly opposed to aether, the pure upper air (so
too in Greek ἀήρ and αἰθήρ),--“01011(1,’ ‘mist.’ Horace is here satirising
Homer, who represents his divinities as rescuing a defeated 11610 by this some-
what unfair device whenever convenient, ay. Il. 3. 380. 15. resorbens,
‘ sucking back! The metaphor is from a shipwreck: the breakers had cast
Horace safe upon the shore ; a back eddy had sucked his friend back amid
‘ the raging surf ' (freta aestuosa), cf. ἀναροιβδεῖ, Ηο111. Od. 12. 105.

17. ergo, cle. since after so many dangers you are safe at home. obli-
gatam redde, ‘ duly offer the banquet as you are bound.' reddo is frequently
not ‘to give back‚' but ‘to give what is due‚' the two meanings being in fact
really 0116 : Pompeius had doubtless bound himself by a vow (voto se obligare)
to offer a feast to Jove, and so when he ‘duly offered ' it, he was but ‘giving
back ' to the god what the god had given him. obligatam, ‘ that is bound
on you‚' i.e. to which you are bound: the word is technical with regard 10

religious obligations, aq. Cic. Leg. 2. 16. 41 voti sponsio quia obliyamur deo
(cf. reliyio, perhaps from reliyare).

21. oblivioso . . . Here Horace represents the feast to which he invites
his friend as actually realised, and himself as urging on the attendants to
their various duties. oblivioso, ‘that brings forgetfulneSS,' i.e. of care, cf.

Massico: from Mons Massicus in Campania. 22. ciboria: large cups
shaped like the pod of the Egyptian bean (colocasium). 23. conchis·
Shells, or vessels made to imitate shells, were used 10 contain unguents. So
