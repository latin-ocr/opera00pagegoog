doubtful whether to J‘oin the sedition. ad arma is the actual cry raised,
and its repetition by the poet is a graphio representation of its repetition by
the mob ; of. io Triumphe repeated 4. 2. 49.

17. te semper anteit . . . Wickham refers to Lessing's criticism on
this passage to the effect that the poet has here trespassed on the painter's
art3 a painter portraying Destiny must show who she is by symbols, a poet
has other and better ways. Some imagine that Horace was thinking of some
actually existing picture or representation, and indeed an ancient Etruscan
mirror from Perugia exhibits Athrpa (=Atropos, or Destiny) in the act of
fixing a nail with a hammer as a sign of immutable fate. Necessitas
personified=’Avd·ytny, cf. 3. 1. 14. MS. authority is strong for sema, instead
of saeva, but the image is surely that of a stern lictor who ‘ precedes ’ rather
than of a slave who follows. How too can Necessity be the ‘ slave ' of Fortune?
anteit: scanned as a disyllable, cf. antehac 1. 37. 5 ; anteis Ep. 1. 2. 70.
18. clavos trabales. Nails such as are placed in beams. For the symbol-
ical use cf. 3. 24. 5 adamatinos clavos, · Cic. 2 Verr. 5. 21 ut hoc beneficium,
quemadmodum dicitur, clavo trabali figeret. cuneos: also used for fasten
inq, as wedges are still in scaffolding. 19. Severus uncus . .

‘stubbom clamp and molten lead? i. e. materials for building with greatest
fixity. Stones are often united by means of* iron bars fastened in with lead.

21. albo panno. Typical of guileless innocencc. Servius on Virg. Aen.
1. 292 says that offerings to Faith were made with the hand wrapped ‘in 3
white cloth.’ 22. nec comitem abnegat, sc. 33, ‘ nor refuses her
companionship.' This stanza is without doubt awkwardly expressed. Horace
says that ‘ Faith accompanies Fortune whenever in changed attire (indicative
of missortune) she in hostile mood quits a (formerly) powerful mansion!
Now ‘ to follow, or accompany Fortune ' always means to vary or change
in conduct according as Fortune changes (cf. Ov. Pont. 2. 3. 10 et cum
Fortuna statque caditque fides, and in English, ‘ friends and fortune fiy
together ’) 3 but Horace means the exact opposite, he means that fides does
‘not vary in calamity. What he intends to say is, ‘ when a man is unfortunate
113 quits his great mansion taking his ill-fortune with him, but Faith accom-
panies his ill-fortune and remains with him notwithstanding his ill-fortune ' ;
but he has said it very obscurely. For comitem abnegat: comitem 33
abnegat cf. Virg. Aen. 2. 591 confessa deam ; Ov. A. A. 1. 127 si qua re-
puqnarat nimium omnitemque neyarat. 26. diffugiunt . . . ‘ when casks
are drained to the lees friends scatter, too treacherous to bear the yoke equally.’
Cf. the Gk. proverb ζεῖ χύτρα ζῇ φιλία ; Ecclesiasticus vi. 10.

29. iturum. Augustus never visited Britain, but proposed to do so in
34 B.c. and 27 3-3. The latter is probably the date of this Ode. ultimos
Britannos: cf. Virg. Ecl. 1. 66 penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos ,· Tac.
Agric. 30 Britannos terrarum ac libertatis extreme. The poets rarely mention
Britain except as a type of remotest barbarism. Cf. 1. 21. 15, 3. 4. 33 Bri-
tannos hospitibus feros, 4. 14. 48 remotis Britannis. 30. recens examen,
⁶ recently levied troop. ' examen=eoea9men=exa9imen (ἐξαγόμενον), 3 force

‘led out.' 32. Oceano mbro=E1ythraewn mare, the Indian Ocean,
including the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.

33. cicatricum fratrumque. Hendiadys (cf. 2. 7. 9 11. ), - ‘the scars
inflicted by brethren on brethren.’ At the same time the Roman poet
speaking of Roman disgrace purposely uses a phrase that rather suggests than
expresses the fact, cf. 1. 2. 21 11. 34. dura aetas, ‘an age of iron.'
