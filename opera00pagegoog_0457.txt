thou my song, Ι Urania, and fit audience find though few) 75. vilibus in
ludis: Horace prophesied this fate for his books, Ep. l. 20. 17; and this
was his fate: cf. J uv 7. 226 quot stabant pueri cum totus decolor esset Ι Flaccus,

· et haereret nisyro fuligo Maroni.

76. equitem, ‘the stalls' :the knights occupied the first 14 rows 111 1118

to the law of Roscius Otho 67 B.c.‚.Juv. 3. 159 sic libitum vano quinos di-
stinoeit Othoni. 77. Arbuscula: a mima, or actress, famous about twenty
years before this satire was written ; Cic. ad Att. 4. 15. 6 quaeris nunc de
Arbuscula .· valde placuit. She was hissed (explosa) apparently by the ground-
lings of the pit on one occasion. 78. Pantilius ε 1118 name is found in
inscriptions. Horace, however, evidently selects it here because it seems to
suggest the derivation he assigns to it. For, as 118 compares the man to abug,
he evidently connects Pantilius with πᾶν . . . τίλλειν. Who was the person
intended is unknown. 79. Demetrius, line 118 n. 80. Fannius

Od. 2. 9. 5. Octavius, not Octavian, whom Horace always calls either Caesar,

good opinion. One of 1118 commonest meanings of ambitio is a desire to please

orationem suam . . . petivitque a me ut eam ne ambitiose corrigerem. 85. fratre,
Pedius Poplicola, cf. line 28. 86. Bibule : probably L. Calpurnius
Bibulus, who may have been a fellow·student with Horace at AthenS, and a
comrade in military service 3 for he went to Athens in 45 Β. 0., and afterwards
joined Brutus, who was his step-father. Servi, voc. sing, perhaps Servius
Sulpicius Rufus the younger, praised by Cicero ad Fam. 4. 3 ; 4. 53 13. 27.

λέγω. 92. Addressed to an amanuensis. haec: this satire, which
Horace orders to be added to the preceding, cf. Prop. 3. 23. 23, where, after
penning a sort of poetica] advertisement respecting his lost tablets, he adds :
i puer, et citus haec aliqua propone columna.
