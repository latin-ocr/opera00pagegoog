my childhood so will I be yourS‚ O MuseS,' etc.

Sabine farm among the hius, cf. 2. 18. 14 n. 22. frig-idum. Praeneste

Rome. 23. Tibur supinum, ‘ the slopes of Tibur! supinum, lit.
‘upturned ’ : the opposite of pronus. 24. liqmdae Baias, ‘the clear ' or
‘bright air of Baiae ’ ; cf. Virg. G. 4. 59 per aestatem liquidam, ‘through the
clear summer air.' Horace elsewhere alludes to the ‘brightness of Baiae‚’
Ep. 1. l. 83 nullus in orbe sinus Bais praelucet arnoeniS. It was the
Brighton of Rome, and the whole coast from Baiae to Puteoli was studded
with villas 3 see Merivale, c. 40. Kiessling gives ‘by the sea,' so that Baiae
is here described as ‘ a watering-place ' l

25. amioum gives the reason for his preservation, ‘because I was dear
to . . .’ fontibus, ay. Castalia, Hippocrene. » 27. non . . . arbor,
‘neither did an army routed at Philippi nor an aceursed tree destroy me.'
For Horace at Philippi cf. 2. 7. 9-16, and for the ‘accursed tree’ 2. 13 Int.
28. Palinurus: a promontory on the W. of Lucania so called from the
pilot of Aeneas who lost his life there (Virg. Aen. 6. 373). We know nothing
of Horace having been nearly shipwrecked. 30. Bosphorum: cf. 2. 13.
14 n. 33. Britannos hospitibus feros : cf. 1. 35. 29 n. Their reputa-
tion for cruelty was in great measure due to the reports of human sacrifices

Cantabri ; cf. 2. 6. 2 n. For the Geloni cf. 2. 9. 23 n. ; Virgil describes them
as drinking ‘milk coagulated with horse's blood ' (G. 3. 463 et Zac concretum
eum sanquine potat equino). 36. scythicum amnem. The Tanais (Don).

37. vos . . . antro, ‘you too to exalted Caesar, longing to end his
labours so ‘soon as he has disposed among the towns his war-worn squadrons,
give repose in a Pierian cave.’ N otice the emphatic vos connecting this with
the preceding stanzas. simulzsimulac. 38. For addidit most MSS.
give abdidit and a few reddidit. Orelli supports addidit by Tac. Ann. 13. 31
coloniae Capua atque Nuceria additis veteranis firmatae sunt, where the
reference is as here to giving soldiers assignments of land at the close of a
campaign in the neighbourhood of various towns (see Virg. Ecl. 1).' abdidit
is explained as suggesting the idea of a well-won retirement (cf. Ep. 1. 1. 5),
but this idea is harshly expressed by speaking of the troops as ‘hidden in
the towns! reddidit gives excellent sense, bu't seems a correction, for, had it
been original, it is difficult to see why it should have been altered to the
more difficult addidit or abdidit. 41. vos . . . almae, ‘you gentle
counsels give, and when they are given rej0ice with kindly care? Τ11ε ‘ gentle
counsels,' which the Muses give and which the victorious Angustus follows, at
once suggest a contrast with the proscriptions of Marius, Sulla, and Antony.

that what they so proffer becomes a real yift, i.e. is not only proffered but
accepted. consilium: scanned as a trisyllable, the second i being pro-
nounced almost like y. So too principium 6. 6, and cf. S. 2. 8. 1 n. 42.
almus, from a20‚=‘fostering‚' ‘nurturing'3 the Muses treated Caesar as
