37. iocus, ‘a mark for jestS‚’ ‘a laughing·stock.' Prop. 2. 24. 15 sed me Ι
fallaci dominae iam pudet 0330 iocum.

38. pelliculam curare, ‘nurse himself ’3 cutem curmae is the ordinary
expression, Ep. 1. 2. 29 ; 4. 15. The sense of ‘hide’ is not lost : cf. Juv. 10.
192 deformem pro cute pellem, of an old man. fi: this imperat. is found
Plaut. Curc. 1. 1. 87 fi mi obsequens ,· Pers. 1. 1. 40 aye fi benignus subveni:
the plural in Cure. 1. 1. 89 fite mihi volentes. cognitor is an advocate
- who took the charge of the case of another party, and represented him 111 the
strictest sense. He was given a power of attorney by his principal to act 101·
him, therein differing from a procurator, whose acts did not bind his principal
necessarily. cum enim cerlis el quasi sollemnibus verbis in locum domini sub-
stituatur coqnitor merito domini loco habetur. procurator vero . . . salis dare
iubetur ratam rem dominum habiturum Gaius 4. 97, 98. 39. seu rubra
. . . : Furius Bibaculus, nicknamed Alpinus (cf. 1. 10. 36), had probably
introduced 111 some 01 1118 poems two lines which are laughed -at here—one
may have been infantes statuas iam rubra Canicula findit .· another, we know
from Quintil. 8. 6. 17, was Iuppiter hilca-‘ms cana nive conspuit Alpes,
conspuet (41), ‘ sputter over,' being a word manifestly out 01 place in heroic
verse. For Iuppiter Horace comically substitutes Furius‘, the author's own
name, adding a description 01 Furius himself as pingui tentus omaso,
‘distended with fat tripe,’ which accounts 101· 1118 sickneSS. Many editors
hold there is no parody in rubra . . . statuas, but that they are Horace's
own words. This is most unlikely: a more ranting line was never penned,
and it exactly suits tumidus, applied by Horace to this same FuriuS‚ 1. 10.
36. The general meaning is, ‘persevere in the heat 01 the dog-days; per-
severe in the depth 01 winter.’ 40. infantes statuas, ‘ the dumb
statues ’ ; an expression introduced by Furius, 01 which he was probably very
proud. There was a proverb statua taciturnius Ep. 2. 2. 83, and statues
were often made 01 wood (as that 01 Priapus, 1. 8. 1), and that would split
and crack (cf. findet) in hot weather. omaso, ‘tripe.' Tripe was a
cheap dish3 800 Ep. 1. 15. 34: probably Furius, an unsuccessful poet, could
afford no better, and, being a greedy man, stuffed himself with it.

42. cubito . . . tangens, ‘nudging with the elbow,’ ἀγκῶνι νύττων. Pers.
4. 34 est prope le ignotus cubito qui tanyal. 44. adnabunt thunni seems
to have been proverbial, from Herodotus 1. 62, where the oracle says to Peisi-
stratus ἔρριπται δ’ ὁ βόλος, τὸ δὲ δίκτυον ἐκπεπέτασται, Ι θύννοι δ’ οἰμήσουσι
σεληναίης διὰ νυκτός. cetaria, ‘fish-pondS‚' cf. vivaria, ‘ preserves,' Ep.
1. 1. 79. 46. ‘ If any one has a sickly son heir-apparent to a fine fortune.’
sublatus, ‘reared‚' from the custom 01 the father taking up from the ground
a child he intended to own and to keep (tollere). 47. caelibis obsequium
‘homage to a bachelor.' The caelebs is of course not the man with the sick
son, but the locuple-3 01 28 seq. Tiresias tells Ulysses to choose people with
heirs as a mark 101· toadying‚ as well as orbi, to divert suspicion. 48.
adrepe officiosus, ‘worm your way by your attentione? ut is epexe-
getic 01 111 spem in 47, and is not ‘in order that! The captator is directed to
worm his way towards the hope 01 two things: first, that he will be made
secundus heres ,⁶ secondly‚ that the heres will die: both were necessary; hence
el . . . et. What is here described as in spem, ul scribare secundus heres is by
Tac. Ann. 1. 8 expressed as in spem secundam, speaking of the will of
Augustus. For in spem followed by ul, see Plaut. Bacch. 3. 1. 3 nisi quem
spes reliquere omnes, 0330 ut ‚fv-uqi possiet ; Ausonius, Id. 2. 46 consul ul ipse
