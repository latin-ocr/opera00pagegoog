here. Cf. Quint. 5. 10. 67 cum risu tota ‘res solatum· Cic. de Or. 2. 58. 236

Others as Schiita understand, ‘ the very statutes themselves will melt with
laughter,' tabulae being those of the XII Tables which prescribed penalties for
libellous writing. Orelh' took tabulae to mean the votes of the iudices, which
he says leniores fient risu ; but the voting tablets of the iudices are always

tabellae, never tabulae.

SA'I'IRE II
A Simple Diei. DATE (ἓ) 33 B.o.

An essay on the advantages of simple fare. Horace says he learned the
substance, or perhaps the very words of his discourse, from one OfelluS, a
farmer of the old style, whose land had been taken stom him, and assigned by
Octavian to one of his veterans‚ named Umbrenus (lines 114, 133). Ofellus
probably was a neighbour of Horace, near Venusia, which, we are told by
Appian (Bell. civ. 4. 3) was one of the towns whose lands were taken for the
reward of the soldiers after the battle of Philippi, 42 Β. 0.

1. virtus: worth, value, advantage. boni: voc„ ὠγαθοί, ‘ sirs.’ parvo,
‘on a little,’ an abl. of the means. ‘ Man wants but little ' is the idea. Of.

some one else's mouth: Plat. Symp. 177 A; Apol. 20 Ε. quae, ‘the
words which.’ Probably Ofellus is the speaker all through down to line

by the rules of any sect ’ z many MSS. give abnormi. crassaque Minerva,
‘ of home-spun mother—wit ’ (Beare). Minerva, as the goddess of learning,
is often put for a person’s intelligence‚ stock of brains. But she was also
patroness of spinning and weaving3 and Minerva is sometimes used for
spinning or weaving: cf. Virg. Aen. 8. 409 tolerare colo vitam tenuique
Minerva. Both ideas seem to be combined in crassa Minerva. Similar
phrases are iwmlta Minerva A. P. 3853 pinyui Minerva Cic. Lael. 5. 19.
5. stupet aenea, ‘the eye is dazed'3 see 1. 6. 17. insanis, ‘extrava-

the scene is uncertain. Orelli says in familiari nostro circulo, i. e. Horace’s
own circle at Rome ; but it is much better to understand hie to refer to some
spot in Ofellus’ farm, where rural simplicity offered a strong contrast to the
splendours of the city. inpransi, ‘fasting.' hoc refers to inpransi.

9. corruptus, ‘ bribed.' The Judge in this case would have his judgment

broken steed ’: cf. Ov. Her. 10. 138 ab imbre graves. ab with adjectives or
intransitive verbs seems always to denote sequence or result rather than agency.
