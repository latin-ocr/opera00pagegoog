the word sounds somewhat practical and inelegant. 15. privatis is very
emphatic, as in line 13. 16. excipiebat, ‘Jeaught excipio, as distinguished
from eapio,- - ‘to be ready to receive' ; it was specially used of hunters who
received the game driven out of 001701;01.3.12.11 alto latitantem fruticeto
excipere aprum,· Ep. 1. 1. 79. Here t'he word signifies that, whenever there

17. fortuitum . . . caespitem, ‘the chance turs, ' i. e. such as a man
might corne across anywhere. Horace probably refers 10 3 cottage 1001οᾶ
with turs, such 35 were common in country districts, 01. Virg. Ecl. 1. 68
pauperis et tuyuri eonqestum caespite culmen. What‘ the laws did not permit
men to despise' exactly means it is impossible to say, for 1110 whole stanza
lacks reality and sincerity· , Horace would have been the last man in the
world to desire a restoration of the ‘ mud-cabin ’ 013, orto wish to be catechised
as to the historical accuracy of such a phrase as ‘the laws did not permit.'
20. novo, ‘new 0111.’ Others give ‘novel‚' and say 11131 1110 ‘novel stone ' is
‘marb1e,' referring to the well-known boast of Augustus, Suet. Aug. 28 urbem

ODE XVI

‘ Repose is what aa men pray for when in difficulty, but repose, Grosphus,
neither yold nor purple can purcha3e‚ for neither wealth nor position ean yet
rid of the cares and worries of the mind. Contentment is the 9reat remedy ;
and indeed considerinq the short span of life why should we be so ambitione,
so bustiinq, so eayer for chanye? Go where we will, do what we will, care
clinys to us. Try then to be cheerfuZ, make the best os thiozys, and do not
expect perfect happiness : remember that thouyh Achilles’ career was ylorious it
was brief, Tithonus on the other hand was immortal but miserable .· so too you
abound in wealth, and I am poor, butas a compensation I have my 9th of son9.'
