PonncA NOTES 591

7. vanae, ‘unreal'; cf. Ep. 2. 1. 211 n. 8. Species, ‘fancies'z
vanae specie3‚ as Schiitz points out, are not in themselves blameworthy in a
work of imagination: only they must not be inconsistent, like the dreams of
a man suffering from sever. nec pes nec caput, a metaphor suggested
by the comparison with a picture ε cf. Plaut. Asin. 3. 3. 139 ozee eaput ‘nee pes
semoni adparet ,· Capt. 3. 4. 81 yarriet quoi neque pes umquam ‘neque caput
compareat. uni, proleptic: ita ut ‘etna fiat. 9. reddatur, ⁶ is adapted
to.’ natura reram dat, poeta reddit ut debitum—Orelli. pictoribus
. . . potestas: the obJection of a critic. 10. aequa: Acron interprets
this as ‘equaL' The connexion then is: ‘poets have just as much licence of
unrestricted imagination as painters have: but we have seen that there are
limits in the one case ; therefore there must be also in the other! Orelli and
Schiitz give ‘reasonable,' as in aequum ius etc. But ‘ a reasonable power of
unlimited licence ’ is a contradiction in terms, not to be defended by saying
that quidlibet is an intentional exaggeration, corrected in the next line. 11.
petimus quasi poetae, damus quasi critici—Acron. 12. coeant: cf.
Ep. l. 5. 25. 13. geminentur, ‘are paired.'

14. inceptae, ‘plana' 15. purpureus, ‘brilliant'z cf. Od. 3. 15.
15 n. Orelli takes the word=‘ purple ’ and refers to the latus clavus which
bordered the toya praetexta, or to the flounce (instita), sometimes attached to
the stola. This hardly suits the context: the panni are not attached as
appendages to the body of the work, but incorporated here and there in it.
16. lucus et ara: this and the following instances arc probably taken from
contemporary poets, but we cannot identify any of thern. There may, how-
ever, be a reference to the worship of Diana Nemorensis at Aricia. 18.
Rhenum, an adjective ; cf. od. l. 15. 10 n. 19. nuno, ‘at the moment.’
erat, from the point of view of the rcader, who goes back to the time of writ-
ing the poem. cupressum: the scholiasts tell a story of a bad painter,
who could paint nothing but a cypress. A shipwrecked man requested him
to paint a picture of his disaster, that 116 might, according to the custom,
carry it about, and get alms (cf. Juv. 14. 301). The painter asked if he did
not want a cypress introduced ; whence the Gk. proverb μή τι καὶ κυπάρισσον
θέλεις ,· applied to one who wishes to introduce ornaments out of place. 21.
coepit institui: cf. Ep. 2. 1. 149 11. Τ116 urceus or ‘pitchcr,' though not
necessarily smaller than the amphora, was so as a rule: and the sentence
gains in point if we suppose that to a vessel of the size of an amphora, the
shape of an urceus was given 3 at any rate, it was something very different.
22. rota, the potter’s wheel ; cf. Senec. Ep. 90. 31 Anacharsis, inquit, invertit
rotam fiyuli‚ ouius circuita vasa formantur ; Hom. 11. 18. 600. exit: cf.
Pers. 1. 45 non 690, eum scribo, si sorte quid aptius emit, . . . laudari metuam.
23. quidvis: restored by Bentley for quod vis of almost all MSS. sim-
plex, i.e. constituting 3 single and uniform whole. dumtaxat, ‘ provided
only it be.’

24-31. The desire to avoid a fault must be directed by hameledqa or the
opposite fault is incurred. 25. specie recti, ‘ by our idea of what is
right ἐ speeies is not here in a bad sense, a mere phantom. The word is often
used in Cicero with the meaning of ‘general notion’ = ἰδέα. 26. levia, ‘smooth-
neSS,’ τὴν λειότητα of the rhetor-iciam, to which vigour and energy (δεινότης)
were in danger of being sacrificed. nervi : cf. Cic. Brut. 31. 121 quis Aristotele
nervosior? Quint. 8. proem. 18 resistam iia, qui omissa rerum, qui nervi sunt
in causis, diliqentia quodam inani circa voces etzalio senescunt. In good Latin
