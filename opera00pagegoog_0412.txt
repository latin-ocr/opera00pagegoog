384· HORACE BOOK 1

‘ bravest one of the house of 'Tyndareus' Tyndaridae is a masc. form, and
includes both men and women. Horace does not mean to say she was merely
as brave as the bravest woman of the house of Tyndareus, but that her
bravery was greater than that of any of that bloody house, whether men or
women. Bentley first established that Tyndaridarum was from Tyndaridae
masc., and not fem. from a barbarous nom. sing. Tyndarida, quoting Synesius,
Epig. Anthol. 4. 4 οὶ τρεῖς Τυνδαρίδαι, Κάστωρ, Ἑλένη, Πολυδεύκης, to show
that a woman could be included in Tyndaridae, and comparing such expressions
as fratres for brothers and sisters, reyes for king and queen.

101. The reply of the avarus. Maenius, ‘like Maenius.’ For the omission
of ut, cf. Ep. 1. 2. 42 rusticus exspectat. Maenius (cf. Ep. 1. 15. 26) and
Nomentanus (cf. 1. 8. 11 ; 2. 1. 22 ; 2. 3. 175) are typical spendthriftS, and
are mentioned 111 the fragments of Lucilius which have come down to us;
Maenia’ columnam cum peteret Lucil. 1171 Lach. 3 qai te Nomentane matum
iam †cetera perdat Lucil. 69 Lach. The names had become proverbial in
Horace's time, and we should err greatly if we supposed, with the scholiasts‚
that they were real names of his contemporaries, Maenius is said to have
sold his house to Cato the censor in 184 B.o., to form a site for the Basilica
Porcia. Porphyrion tells a story of him that he was heard wishing in a loud
voice in the Capitol, on the lst of January, that he might owe 400,000
sesterces; and, on being asked why he wished it, replied that he actually
owed 8ΟΟ,ΟΟΟ. MS. authority here is in favour of Naevius ; but we do not
read elsewhere of Naevius as a spendthrift. In 2. 2. 68 Naevius is simplex,
and allows his slaves to offer greasy water to his guests: such a character
scarcely suits this passage.

102. pergis . . . componere, ‘you are proceeding to reconcile opposites.'
In proposing to pass from avarice to prodigality, you speak as if these vices
were side by side, as if there were but one step from 0118 to the other, whereas
they are diametrically opposite. For this use of componere cf. 1. 5. 29 aversos
soliti componere amicos. componere also means ‘to pit together ' (ξυνιέναι) as
a pair of gladiators‚ 1. 7. 20, and so most take it here, but that does not give
good sense. How can one be said to pit together foes who are already engaged ’.ἱ
What absurdity would there be in matching against each other things that are
hostile to each other 2 104. veto te, sc. esse : the man is already avaras,
so fieri is out of place with te. Most place the comma after'fieri. vappam,
‘a roue,' properly must spoiled by spontaneous fermentation, hence nomen
probrosum hominum eum deyeneravit animus Plin. H. N. 14. 20. 125.
nebulo (nebula), ‘ a good for nought,' ‘scamp.'

105. quiddam, ‘something‚' implying a good deal: so est aliquid is a
meiosis for est maynum. Tanais, acc. to Porph., was a eunuch, a freedman
of Maecenas, or L. Munatius Plancus: and, ace. to the same, Visellius was
herniosus 3 but very likely this is only guessing. 106. modus, ⁶ a mean '
in which virtue lies acc. to Aristotle. Of. Lucan 2. 380 haec duri inmota
Catonis, Ι secta fuit, servare modum finemque tenere.

108.0 illuc unde abii redeo qui nemo ut avarus se probet: ‘I
return to the point whence Ι started, asking, how is it that no avaricious
man is satisfied with his lot.' After qui understand fiat. Horace here dis-
tinctly refers to the first three verses of the Satire. This is shown by the
sentiment, by the words diversa sequentes, and by the exactly similar use of
nemo taken up by quisque. It seems almost certain that qui, which was the
point at which Horace started, and which vet. Bland. preserveS‚ is the
