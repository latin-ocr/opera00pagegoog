insignibus armis hostiam usi sunt .· Campani ab superbia cl odio Samnitium
qladiatores (qaod spectaculum inter epulas erat) 60 ornatu armarunt, Samniti-
umque nominc compellaverant. Horace humorously represents the stock of
poems which the two poets bring and alternately inflict upon each other,
drawing out mutual complimentS, but really inflicting painful weariness, as
inexhaustible ; and compares the contest between them to that of two heavy·
armed, well-matched gladiators‚ whose protracted struggle lasts till the dark-
ness of evening puts an end to it. 99. discedo, ‘I come off ' from the
contest. Alcaeus: l. 19. 29 3 od. 2. 13. 26. puncto, ‘vote‚’ a meaning
of the word retained from the days of viva voce voting, when the royatores
would ask each voter, as he passed along the pentec, for whom he voted, and
record the answer by pricking a tablet. So we still retain the term ‘ polling
booth ' even under the ballot. punctum is used for ‘vote ⁹ similarly in A. P.
343 3 Cic. pro Plane. 22. 53 non nullas (tribus tulerunt) punctis paene tolidem ,-
pro Mur. 34. 72 recordor quantam . . . punctorum nobis detraxerint. 100.
adposcere, ‘ to demand in addition( only found elsewhere in Ter. Haut. 4.
7. 10. 101. Mimnermus ε cf. 1. 6. 65. Although Callimachus (flor. 260-
240 Β.ο.) was ranked by some critics (6.9. Quintilian 10. 1. 58 princeps habetur
Callimachus) as the first of elegiae poets, Horace seems to have agreed with
ovid, Am. 1. 15. 14 quamvis inqenio non valet, arie valet. In any case Mim-
nermus (flor. 640-600 B.c.) was the first to use elegiae verse for love poetry
(cf. Prop. 1. 9. 11 plus in amore valet Mimnermi versas Homero), and it was
naturally a higher compliment to give to an erotic poet the name of the
founder of his style of poetry, than that of one who was not especially dis·
tinguished in this department, and who had devoted himself also to so many
branches of literature, prose as well as verse. optivozadoptivo, adscito
Porph. The word is properly a legal term : Gaius 1. 154 vocantur autem Izi
qui nominatim testamento tutores dantur, dativi ; qai ex optione §almaniam
optivi. Hence it means ⁴ any which he may choose.' crescit, ‘is glorified.’

103-105. So lony as I am myself composiny, and am a candidate for popu-
lariiy, I have to put ap unffi much. .· bal as soon as I return to my censes, Ι
would stop my ears when poete recita and sear no revenqe on their part. Orelli
argues that the rhythm of the verse requires us to take inpune with legen-
tibus, understanding that the poetasters can thenceforward recite without
any fear of retaliation on the part 01· Horace (as in Juv. l. 1-3). But the
context requires us rather to regard Horace as now able to do what he dared
not do before. 104. studim, ‘ambition‚’ not as in line 82. mente
recepta: cf. A. P. 296. 105. obturem: Roby 1534, S. G. 642.

106-125. Bad poels, thouqh ridiculed, are delithed raith their own pro-
ductione. But qood poetry requires riyorous sels· criticism, with a caresal
treatment Qf the diction; and ease in ‘im-ilinq comes only of labor-icus traininq.
107. scribentes, ‘while they are witing: i. e. in the mere act 01· doing so.
cf.catu11.22.15 neque idem uniquam Ι aeque 631 beatus ac poema cum scribit.
108. si taceas, laudant, i. 6. it is their habit to praise their compositions‚
and they would do sc, even if you should say nothing about them. cf. Mayor
on Juv. 10. 141, Roby 1574, S. G. 654. 109. legitimum, ‘according
10 the rules of art ’ ; A. P. 274. fecisse: the perfect because the result
rather than the process is the obJect 01· desire: cf. 1. 17. 53 Od. 1. 1. 4 n.
110. cum tabulis, ‘along with his tablet8‚’ i.e. when he begins to write.
Wax tablets were used for the first rough draft, which might need correction
(cf. S. 1. 10. 72 saepe stilum vertas) ; then the fair copy was made upon paper.
These tablets for notes were often called paqillares (Pliny, Ep. 1. 6. 1 ς 3. 5.
