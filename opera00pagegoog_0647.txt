POETICA NOTES 619

but ‘ gaining fame after these.' 402. Tyrtaeus, an Athenian sent (about
640 Β.ο.) to the aid of the Spartans, when hard pressed by the war with the
revolted Messenians. We have about 120 lines of his elegiae poetry, contain-
ing exhortations to valour, and smaller fragments of his ἐμβατήρια, anapaestic
marching songs. His poetry was highly prized at Sparta, and sung in time
of war: on the strength of it Leonidas pronounced him ἀγαθὸς νέων ψυχὰς
αἰκάλλειν. mares: ef. Ep. 1. 1. 64. 403. exacuit: for the verb in
sing. cf. Od. 2. 13. 38 n. sortes, ί(111011) oracles (cf. line 219 n.) were
uttered in verse . . .' The oracles of Delphi, of Bakis, and of the Sibyl are
probably especially intended.

404. vitae monstrata via est, by the gnomic poets, Solon, Theognis,
Phocylides. gratia regum: Pindar, Simonides and Bacchylides were
patronised by Hiero and Thero, Anacreon by Polycrates of Samos. ‘ The rise
and prevalence of tyrants in Greece, and their desire of spreading culture
about them, created a demand, and a comfortable prospect for professional
court poets '—Mahaffy‚ Gk. Lit. 1. 206. 405. ludus, ‘ festivals '; cf. Ep. 2. 1.
140 seq. Acron refers this to the lyre, Orelli to the dramatic representations at
the Dionysia τὰ κατ’ ἀγρούς 111 December, which marked the close of the year's
toil: both unduly limit the meaning. But Acron is right in taking et . . .
finis as a quasi-adjectiva] addition, ‘to finish their long toils.' 406. ne,
final : ‘(this I say) lest ' etc.; cf. Ep. 1. 1. 13 ; Od. 2. 4. 1 ; 4. 9. 1.

408-418. Not only natural Micy, but also trained skill is needful for
success in poetry. 408. natura . . . an arte: a theme often discussed.
Pindar was perhaps the first to lay stress on the great importance of φυή, as
compared with μελέτη z cf. Olymp. 2. 86; ib. 9. 100 τὸ δὲ φυᾷ κράτιστον
ἅπαν· πολλοὶ δὲ διδακταῖς ἀνθρώπων ἀρεταῖς κλέος ὤρουσαν ἄρεσθαι, ἄνευ δὲ
θεοῦ σεσιγαμένον οὐ σκαιότερον χρῆμ’ ἕκαστον, though in Ol. 11. 20 110 admits
θήξαις δέ κε φύντ’ ἀρετᾷ. N aturally Horace’s solution of the question—that
both natural gists and training are needed—is the one generally accepted. As
regards oratory Plato says (Phaedr. 269 D) εἰ μέν σοι ὑπάρχει φύσει ῥητορικῷ
εἶναι, ἔσει ῥήτωρ ἐλλόγιμος, προσλαβὼν ἐπιστήμην καὶ μελέτην z and so Cicero
in his de Oratore often expresses his opinion that the first requisite for the
orator is natural capacity (0.9. 1. 25. 113 sie sentio, naturam primum atque in-
qenium ad dicendum vim adferre mammam) but that he must also be omnibus
eis artibus, quae sunt libero diqnae‚ perpolitus (72). cf. also Ovid, Trist. 2. 424
Ennius ingenio ηιαεσιῖηιαε, arte rudis .· and Am. 1. 15. 14 quamvis inqenio non
valet, arte valet, of Callimachus. Quintil. I. Prooem. 26 illud tamen inprimis
testandum est, nihil praecepta atque artes valere, nasi adiuvante παίωνα.

409. divite vena: cf. Od. 2. 18. 10 n. 410. rude, ‘untrained'
quid. prosit, ‘what use it is,' is supported by all MSS. of any value3 cf.
od. 1. 26. 10 nil sine te mei prosunt honores. Bentley read possit. sic, ‘to
such a degree.' 411. coniurat: Cicero never uses the word except in
the bad sense ‘ to conspire ' ; but virgil and Livy have it simply for ‘ band
together.’ Here the word seems specially chosen to denote the alliance of
two things generally reckoned enemies—genius and technical skill.

412. metam,⁴ properly denoting the two turning-posis in the Circus :
hence the word acquires two distinct meanings (1) turning-post, (2), as here,
goal. The former is far the more common, the regular word for ‘goal ' being
calx, cf. Ep. 1. 14. 9 : see Wilkins. 413. puer, ‘ when a boy ' : sudavit et
alsit, ‘has borne heat and cold ' z the tense is the true perfect, not the gnomic
or aoristic perfect. 414. Pythia cantat, ‘plays at the Pythian games'3 the
