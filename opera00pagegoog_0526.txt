498 HORACE · 110011 1

et rebus honestis: probably not a hendiadys: but studiis: ‘ studies,’ as
in 2. 2. 823 S. 1. 10. 21. 37. nam marks surprise or indignation; cf.
Plaut. Aul. 42 nam cur me verberas? Ter. Andr. 3. 5. 6 nam quid dicam
patri? Luke xxiii. 22 τί ’γὰρ κακὸν ἐποίησεν ; The force is the same as that
01 1110 interrogative with nam suffixed, and some MSS. here have curnam.
38. festinas . . . differs: the omission of the copula is usual in the case
01 two contrasted questions, 39. est animum: cf. Hom. Il. 6. 202 ὃν

’ θυμὸν κατέδων, Cic. Tusc. 3. 26. 63 ipse suum cor edens ‚· Od. 1. 17. 4 n.

40. dimidium . . . habet: there is a Greek proverb ἀρχὴ δέ τοι ἥμισυ
παντός (01. Soph. Frag. 715), our own ‘well begun is half done.’ aude,
‘have courage ’ ; Virg. Aen. 8. 364 aude, hospes, contemnere opes. 42. rus-
ticus exspectat, ‘ is like the clown waiting.’ defluat: Roby 1664,
S. G. 692. This seems to be a reference to some fable of a rustic waiting
by a river until all the water had run by ; but as no trace 01 811011 0 fable has
been discovered, it may be only invented by Horace for this passage. Cf.

. J uv. 14. 25 rusticus exspectas. 43. in omne volubilis aevum, like

Tennyson's brook, ‘but Ι go on 101 ever.' The rapid rhythm is imitative.

44-54. Men aim at securin9 the yood thinys of life, but no worldly pos-
session-s can ⁴qive health of body or of mind, and these are both needed jor
enJ'oyment. 44. argentum, ‘money,' as in 1. 18. 23 ; S. 1. 1. 86 3 2. 6. 10,
0 meaning common in Plautus, Juvenal, and late prose, but not found in good
prose. A more common meaning is ‘ silver-plate,’ as in 1. 6. 17 ; 16. 76 ; S. 1.
4. 283 Od. 4. 11. 6. beata, ‘rich‚' Od. 1. 4. 14 ; 3. 7. 3; S. 2. 8. 1 ; so
ὄλβιος 101 πλούσιος 111 Homer. pueris creandis, ‘to bear children.' 'l'he
phrase is probably a technical one. Gellius (4. 3) says that Sp. Carvilius
divorced a wife to whom he was warnily attached, because she bore him no
children, regarding this as a religious duty quod iurare a censoribus coactus
erat, uxorem se liberum quaerundum ,qratia habiturum .· 01. Ρ10111. Α111. 2. 1.
26 quod tibi sempiternum salutare sit, liberis procreandis . . . volo te uxorem
domum ducere ,· Suet. J ul. 52 uxores liberorum quaerendorum causa. There is
an intentional irony in the use of beata, as if a rich wife were needed to bear
offspring. 45. pacantur, ‘ are brought into subJection ' like barbarous
lands, subdued by the Roman arms: cf. Ov. Pont. 1. 2. 109 pacatius
arvum. We speak 01 1110 ‘ struggle ' of the ,pioneers 01 civilisation with the
forests of the backwoods. So Herod. 1. 126 τὸν χῶρον ἐξημεροῦται. 46

Augustan poets and later writers τ Roby 1479, S. G. 608. 2 (d). 50.
cogitat, ‘ means ' ; so often 111 Cicero’s speeches and in lighter prose and verse. ”
52. tabula, ‘ a plank‚' sometimes has picta added, when it 18 used = ‘ picture ' ;
cf. Plaut. Men. 1. 2. 34 tabulam pictam in pariete, but more commonly the
epithet is omitted. fomenta: the parallelism with paintings and music
shows that this denotes something which is agreeable 10 1110 healthy, but not
10 1110 diseased. Hence any reference to medicinal applications here is quite out
01 place. Diintzer shows from Seneca (de Provid. 4. 9 quem specularia semper
ab afflatu vindicarunt, cuius pedes inter fomenta subinde mutata tepuerunt,
cuius cenationes subditus et parietibus circumfusus calor temperavit, hunc levis
aura non sine periculo strinyet) that such fomenta (2 hot-water bottles) were
actually used by the luxurious to keep the feet warm ε but a man suffering
from the gout 111 1118 feet would get little pleasure from them. 54. sincerum
