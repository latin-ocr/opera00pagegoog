rhetorical question used when something confirmator-y is about to be added:

see 2. 3. 132 n. coneum-Itur: impersonal, ‘the armies meet in battle-shock.’ ¹

horae momente, ‘in the passage of an hour,’ the time it takes an honr
to pass ; ef. PerS. 5. 78 momento tur-bima, in the time it takes to twirl a man

horae caesus Samni-3, Satricanus captus, et omnia in potestate consulis erant.

Mur. 9. 22 viyilas tu [Sulpici] de nocte ut tuis consultoribus respondeas . . . te
gyallorum, illum buccinarum cantus exsuscitat. puisat, ‘knocks at ' : κόπτει.
Knockers are seldom mentioned among the Greeks and Romans, who generally
kicked at the doors: cf. Od. 1. 4. 13 pulsat pede, of death knocking at the
door. 11. dare vades meant to EPOVisse sureties or bail. The rustic has
been summoned, and having given ba' or his appearance, is obliged to go to

valent ε the use of valeo with inf. is common in Horace as in Lueretius and
Virgil; it is not found in Cicero or Caesar. Fabium: only known to us
from the scholiasts. Porph. gives him the cognomen Maccimus, and Acron
says he was a Roman knight of Narbo, who wrote several volumes on the Stoic
philosophy. 15. quo rem deducam, ‘to what issue Ι bring the matter.’
rem aliquo deducere is used of bringing matters to a decisive crisis, rather than
to a conclusion ; cf. Ellis on Catull. 75. 1. en is to be joined as much with 690
as with faciam : ‘ here I am, ready to grant your wishes. ’ 16. iam, ⁶ at once.’

18. partibus, ‘parts ’ in the drama of life. Hence hinc . . . hine
discedite, because the actors had certain doors of entrance and exit regularly
assigned to them. ‘All the world ’s a staye, Ι And all the men and women

deus . . . dicat: for both construction and sentiment cf. 2. 7. 24. atqui
licet esse beatis, ‘ and yet they have it in their power to be blest‚’ ironical.
The dat. after licet esse is regular: a dat. being understood before esse, it
should take one after it 3 so fieri when tibi precedeS, 1. 6. 25 ; esse A. P. 372.
The ace. is more rare and indefinite, civi Romano licet 6336 Gaditanum,
Madvig 393.v 1. 21. buccas inflet, ‘puff out his cheeks with rage at
them ’ ε illis is ethic dat. Similarly sufflare 36 in Plautuszget in a rage and
scold another, cf. Cas. 3. 3. 19 nescio quid 36 sufflavit uxori suae. φυσᾶν is
thus used, Eur. Iph. Aul. 125 μέγα. φυσῶν θυμὸν ἐπαρεῖς 381 τί δεινὰ φυσᾷς ‚·
22. facilem, ‘compliantss esp. used of the gods: cf. Ov. Her. 16. 280 sic
