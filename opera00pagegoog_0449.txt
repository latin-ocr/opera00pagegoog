sarmit 1x NOTES 421

the circle of literary men whom Maecenas had gathered about him; how
Aristius Fuscus met them, and enjoyed Horace’s discomfiture, and would not
help him to get rid of the bore, from whom at last he was saved by the accident
of his adversary in a lawsuit falling in with him, and taking him off to Court.

Vulpius guessed that this bore was Propertius, the young Umbrian poet ;
and it is pointed out that Propertius never mentions Horace by name, nor
Horace Propertius, though Horace repeatedly mentions Virgil, VariuS, Tibul-
lus, and other contemporary poete, while Propertius mentions Virgil with
admiration ; cf. Ep. 2. 2. 100, where quis nisi Callimachus is probably a sneer
’ at Propertius, and see separate edition. Chronology, however, is decidedly
against this, for Propertius could not have been born before 52, probably not
earlier than 49 ; while this Satire can hardly be later than 34.

1. ibam forte ε a fragment of Lucilius begins with the words ibat sorte
arie-3. via Sacra z the principa] street in Rome ε it ran through the Forum
on to the Capitol. 2. meditans, ‘composing'3 cf. Od. 3. 25. 5 11.
nugarum, ‘some poetic trifle '; cf. Catull. 1. 4 meas esse aliquid putare
nuqas ,· Mart. 5. 80. 3 dum nostras ἱεράς exigisque nugae. totus in illie,
‘quite absorbed in it.’ Cf. Ep. 1. 1. 11 omnis in hoc summ 1 Tim. iv. 15
ταῦτα μελέτα, ἐν τούτοις ἴσθι. 3. accurrit and arrepta: stronger than
occurrit and prehensa, denote the forwardness of the man at once. 4. quid
agis, ‘how are you 2² a common formula of greeting ; cf. Mart. 2. 67 occurris
quocumque loco mihi, Postume, clamas Ι protinus et prima est haec tua vox
‘quid aslis 2 ' dulcissime rerum, ‘dearest in the world ² ; cf. Ov. Her.
4. 125 pulcherrime rerum ,· 9. 107 maxime rerum. Acron joined quid rerum
together: and quid rerum is often used, but much more often with gerere
than (κρᾶτα ay. Catull. 28. 4 quid rerum yeritis? 5. ut nunc est, ‘ at
present.' Cf. Cic. ad Att. 15. 5. 3 ut ‘nunc quidem est. cupio omnia quae
vis is a neutra] form of polite address 3 cf. Plaut. Pers. 5. 1. 14 omnia quae
tu vie, ea cupio. Having said which, Horace walks on.

6. numquid vis: a broader hint that he wants no more of the intruder's
company, for numquid vis is the regular form for parting company: ‘have
you any commands ’.ἱ ’ occupo, ‘I break in,’ before he had time to begin.
’7. noris nos, ‘ yes; Ι want you to make my acquaintance ἐ in answer to
Horace's question, numquid zris, which he refuses to take as the close of the
interview. It was common enough to reply to this formula by a statement of
what was desired. Of. Plaut. Capt. 1. 2. 82 ‘numquid vis Ζ Heg. venias temperi ‚-
Mil. Glor. 2. 6.- 92 numquid nunc aliud me vis? Pe. ne ‘me noveris. docti:
the epithet of doctus was assumed by those who were versed in Greek literature
and mythology, and especially by those poets who imitated the learned style
of the Alexandrine school. Hence the word constantly isz‘poetic,’ cf. Od.
1. 1. 29. , 10. puero, i.e. pedisequo, a page. 11. Bolane: a choleric
man, cerebros‘eoe, who would have told such a bore to go ἐς κόρακας, without
more ado. So the cerebrosus, 1. 5. 21, belabours the sleeping sailor.

15. iamdudum video, πάλαι ὁρῶ, ‘ Ι have noticed this long time ² ε
iamdudum in this sense always takes a present. nil agis, ‘ it’s no use,’ a
common phrase. 16. prosequar, ‘I will escort you,’ has less MS.
authority than persequar, ‘I will stick to you ’ς but Horace’s reply is in
favour of prosequar, as it is a polite declining of an offer of company. 1'7.
circumagi, ‘go out of your way.’ visere, ‘ to call on a sick friend.’
