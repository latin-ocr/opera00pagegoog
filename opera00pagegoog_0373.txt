his soul proclaims its real dignity and unchanging rank whenever it prompts
him to act with true nobility. Bentley quotes a quantity of phrases which
show that animus consul would not be as novel to a Roman ear as it
is to us, e.g. animus carnifex, censor, dominus, rex, liberator. Others say
that, there being four lines between animus and consul, Horace applies the
word rather to Lollius himself than to animum but surely the whole point

is that, though Lollius himself is no longer consul, yet his nobility of conduct
makes him ever a consul in seul.

41. honestum utili. These two words are often used in the neuter in
ethical treatises almost as substantives, like Gk. τὸ καλόν and τὸ συμφέρον.
They express the two great ends with reference to which moral conduct may
be regulated‚ viz. right and expediency. We do a thing because we think it
either right (honestum) or expedient (utile). 46. recte, with vocaveris3
beatum predicatively: ‘you will not rightly call blessed.’ There is a play
on the word beatum in the Latin: it has two meanings, (1) ‘happy‚' (2) a
conventional meaning: ‘well off‚’ ‘wealthy.’ The owner of large estates is
popularly called beatus, but according to a more correct standard (recte) he
often cloes not deserve the name, cf. 2. 2. 18 11. 48. sapienter, ‘wisely ':
the word describes the aetion of one who not only acts rightly, but acts so
consciously and on principle as the true ‘ wise man ’ should ; cf. Ep. 1. 16. 20.
50. timet, non ille . . . timidus. Mark the antithesis: ‘ and fears dis-
honour worse than death, he who fears not to die for friends or fatherland.’
The pleonastie ille is inserted to call emphatic attention to the fact that he,
who so fears dishonour‚ is the very man who fears nothing besideS.

when your mio-ror ‘reflecte a bristly chin and a different sace you will rem-et

1. Veneris . . . ‘a lord of all love’s gifts.' 2. pluma, ‘down‚' of the
early beard. insperata, i.e. sooner than is expected. 4. nunc et . . .
‘ and the hue which now surpasses the purple rose's bloom has changed and
altered Ligurinas into a hirsute visage.' 6. alterum, ‘ different! Cf. the
celebrated epigram in the Anthology‚ Ἀναθηματικά Ι. ἡ σοβαρὸν ’γελάσασα
καθ’ Ἑλλάδος, ἡ τὸν ἐραστῶν Ι ἐσμὸν ἐνὶ προθύροις Λαῒς ἔχουσα νέων, Ι τῇ
