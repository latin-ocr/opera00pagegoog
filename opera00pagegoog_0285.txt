hugging the dangerous shore.’ To keep 100 01050 111 511010 involves risks from

quae est inter nimium et parum. From observation of the advantages of
moderation had sprung up such proverbial sayings as that inscribed over the
temple of Delphi, Μηδὲν ἄγαν, ‘nothing in exeess '; but it was Aristotle
who first embodied the general idea into a philosophie conception, and made
it the first principle 01 0 system of moral philosophy. He shewed that all
the virtues, eourage (cf. stanza 1), temporanee (cf. stanza 2), etc„ are ‘mean
states ' lying between two extremes, which are ‘ vicious stateS,’ one erring on

“ 1110 51ᾱο of excess, the other of deficiency‚ aq. ‘couragc ' is the ‘mean ' or

virtuous state, lying between excess of eourage, i.e. recklessness, 011 0110 side,
and deficiency of courage, zze. cowmdice, on the other. auream: cf. 1. 5.

place a comma after dilfflt, but the natural division of the verse is against
this, and it also destroys the 00101111 and rhythmical balance of caret obsoleti
sordibus tecti and caret invidenda sobrius aula. caret . . . ‘avoids the
squalor of a tumble-down dwefflng, avoids too in his temperance the envy
that 0 1101000 excites! As in 1-4 Horace has depieted courage as 0 mean
between two extremes, 50 11010 110 depicts ‘temperance ' as a mean equally
removed from (caret . . . caret) squalor aud extravagance. 8. sobrius:
σώφρων, which is used by Aristotle of the man who is ‘temperate in all
things,’ as opposed 10 the man who indulges himself without restraint
(ἀκόλαστος) ; Aristotle adds that this particular virtue has not two opposites‚
‘ as men who are inclined 10 take 100 little pleasure do 1101 0111513 For

bene praeparatum, zze. by the 1110001115 01 philosophy; cf. Sen. de Vita
Beata 8 sapiens in utrumque paratus artzjfae vitae. Horace here inculcates a
virtue for which we have no special name, but which 15 equally removed from
foolish over-confidence and unrcasonable despondency. 15. informes.
So Virg. G. 3. 354 speaks 01 Scythia as ayqeribus ‘niveis informis, ‘ shapeless
