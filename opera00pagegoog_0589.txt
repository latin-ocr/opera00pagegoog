because indignor :ferre nore. possum, and is thus virtually negative. crasse,
‘coarsely' ; cf. S. 2. 2. 3 crassa Minerva. The opposite is tenui filo in line

m'ta rubra croco. Attae: T. Quinctius Atta was a writer of comoediae
toqatae, who died according to Jerome on Euseb. Chron. in 78 B.c. His
fragments abound in archaisms, but are vigorous in style. The cognomen is
explained by Festus as proper to those qui propter vitium crurzcm aut
pedum plantis insistunt et attinyunt mayis terram quam ambulant, not
differing therefore much from Plautus. Some suppose that there is a
reference to this in perambulet; but undoubtedly the primary meaning
of this is explained aright by Acron: in scenam recepta est, ubi flores

latter died in 62 Β.0. 85. inberbi is probably the reading of vet. Bland.
and most good editors have adopted it here, though Keller prefers imberbes,
found in all his MSS. perdenda: the only instance in classical Latin of a

Mars, instituted according to Livy 1. 20 by Numa, had become almost unin-
