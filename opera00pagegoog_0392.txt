Romanus )( emancipatus feminae, and miles )( spadonibus. vallum. These
valli ‘stakes ' were ‘ carried ² by Roman troops to serve in making the vallum
for the camp. 14. potest, τολμᾷ, ‘ can bring himself to‚' though such 611 act
seems impossible for 6 Roman. 16. 801 aspicit : the sun is the universal
witness to all that happens upon earth, especially to deeds of shame and
wrong3 cf. Aesch. Prom. 91 καὶ τὸν πανόπτην κύκλον ἡλίου καλῶε Shelley‚
Prom. ⁶ I ask yon Heaven‚ the all-beholding Sun, Has it not seenie' Soph.
Aj. 845 3 2 Sam. xii. 11 ‘in the sight of this sun ² ; 12 ‘before all Israel and
before the sun.' conopium: κωνωπεῖον (κώνωψ, ‘a mosquito ⁹), our ‘canopy,'
is (1) ‘a mosquito-tent,' (2) ‘a curtained bed' and so a sign of effeminate
1uxury; cf. Prop. 3. 11. 45 foedaque Tarpeio conopia tendere samo.

17. at huc . . . ‘and yet two thousand Gauls, chanting Caesar's name,
turned their snorting steeds hither (i. e. deserted to us).’ The Gauls who thus
deserted Antony were Galatians (Γάλαται, Κέλται) under king Deiotarus.
Wickham with many MSS. reads ad hune, and explains frementes as nom.
τ- ‘ chafing at such a sight,' hunc being = militem spadonibus servientem,
but such Latin is dubious, and frementes must go with equos (cf. Od. 4. 4. 23,
Hom. 11. 4. 227 ἵππους φυσιόωντας), the very horses being described as
‘ snorting' with indignation. Orelli read at hoe and also took frementes as
nom. directly governing hoe, ‘indignant at such a thing.' In any case
the conduct of these barbarians is contrasted with that of the Romans in
Antony's service. N otice verterunt, as elsewhere in poetry tulerunt, dederunt.
19. The meaning of these lines is obscure. They are closely connected with
the preceding lines by que 61111 86 must mark some similar conduct on the part
of some vessels of the fleet, which are described as now ‘lying hid in harbour '
(i. 6. the Ambracian gulf) and not j0ining Antony and Cleopatra. But what
is sinistrorsum citae, and why the odd phrase navium puppes ’.ἰ The latter is
the opposite of ora navium 4.,17, 61111 86 would suggest retreat as opposed to
attack‚ so that perhaps we may take citae as a part. and puppim ciere:
ἀνακρούεσθαι πρύμναν, ‘back water,’ while sinistrorsum is 6 graphic word
natural enough if the writer actually saw them 86 backing ‘ to the left ² into
the Ambracian gulf. Porphyrion explains of flight ‘towards Egypt‚' which
would be to the left of a fleet facing west3 and so Orelli etsi ad fuyam
sinistrorsum vocantur, tamen Cleopatram destituerunt portuque latent.

21. 10 Triumphe. Of. Od. 4. 2. 49. 22. intactas, i.e. that have never
borne the yoke ; cf. Virg. G. 4. 539 intaeta cervice iuven-ca8‚· Aen. 6. 38 yreye
de intacto . . . mactare iuvencos. The reference is to the white bulis (boi-es is
used fem. according to poetical custom) bred by the river Clitumnus (Virg. G.
2. 146) specially for sacrifice in a triumph. 23. ⁶ neither in the J ugurthine
war didst thou bring home such a leader (as Caesar), nor Africanus (sc.
reportasti parem ducem), for whom valour reared his monument over Carthage!
Marius led Jugurtha in triumph, ,J an. 1, 104 Β.6. ; Scipio destroyed Carthage
Β. G. 146. Carthago is described as the ‘ sepulchre ’ (i. 6. everlasting monument)
which Scipio by his valour reared for himself. For sepulchrum in this sense
cf. Stat. silv. 2. 71 et Pharo superba l Pompeio dabis altius sepulchrum, where
Lucan’s poem the Pharsalia is described as a ‘ lostier memorial of Pompey than
the proud Pharos. ' Africano (sc. betto) has some authority, but ‘a war for which
(Roman) valour reared the sepulchre over (the ruins of) Carthage ' is a startling
phrase instead of ‘ which Roman valour brought to an end by burning Carthage‚’
and not to be justified by such a use of sepelire as Cic. pro L. Man. 11. 30
bellum . . . adventu [Pompeii] sublatum ac sepultum.
