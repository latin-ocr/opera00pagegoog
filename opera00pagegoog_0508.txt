which is moved by strings from without.' For these wooden puppets
(νευρόσπαστα) cf. Apuleius de Mund. 125 illi qui in Ziyneolis figuris yestus
movent quando filum membri quod ayitari solet traaeerinc torquebitur cervix,
nutabit caput, oculi vibrabunt-totus videbitur vivere, and for the metaphor
Plat. Legg. 1. 6441.- τόδε δὲ ἴσμεν ὅτι ταῦτα τὰ πάθη ἐν ἡμῖν οἷον νεῦρα ἢ

sponsare, ‘answer back,' ‘defy‚' used of servants, cf. Plaut. Men. 4. 2. 56
num ancillae aut servi tibi responsant 2 Hence it is excellently used here where
the meaning is that a man should not be the willing slave of his passions. See

quotation ; cf. Cic. Paradox. 2 που. potest non beatissimus esse qui lotus aptus
ex sese, qui in se uno sua ponit ommia. teres atque rotundus, ‘ smooth
and round,’ zze. like a perfect sphere, which the Stoics adopted as a simile for

Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled, Ι That they are not a pipe
