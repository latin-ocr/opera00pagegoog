286 HORAOE Boox 111

5. auditis ? Horace represents himself as hearing the voice of Calliope in
answer to his appeal, but referring to his companions to test the reality of his ’
impression. ludit, ⁶ mocks.' amabilis insania, ⁶ a fond illusion ' ;
oxym0ron, cf. 3. 11. 35 11. The Greeks constantly speak of poetic inspiration
as ἐνθουσιασμός, and μανία, cf. Plat. Phaed. 245 A. 6. pios, ‘holy,' ile..
where only holy beings, human or divine, may enter. Groves and running
streams are always spoken of as favourite haunts of the Muses

9. me fabulosae. Both words are emphatic by their position and
juxtaposition. Cf. 1. 22. 9. The epithet (=‘storied‚' aq. as drawing Venus'
car) in close connexion with the prominent ‘me draws attention to the fact
that the poet’s early years were associated with legends and tales of mystery,
which, like the story of a swarm of bees settling on the lips of the infant
Pindar, indicate a favourite of the MuseS, so that he might well hear the voice
of Calliope. Vulture . . . Apuliae. A very doubtful passage, which,
as it stands, must mean ‘ on Apulian Vultur just beyond the limit of my native
Apulia,’ πλε. 011 Mt. Vultur which is in Apulia, and called Apulian‚ but on a
part of it which stretches just beyond the border of Apulia. The explanation
given is that Horace was born at Venusia on the borders of Apulia and Lucania,
and indeed elsewhere describes himself as ‘half Lucanian, half Apulian '
(Lucanus an Apulus anceps S. 2. 1. 34). Such extreme accuracy however of
local description seems out of place in so imaginative a passage, and the re-
markably harsh variation in the quantity of Apulus and Apulia at once
suggests that the text is corrupt. limina Pulliae (assumed to be his nurse)
has some MS. authority. ConJectures are V. in arduo, in arido, in avio.
Variatiqns in the quantities of proper names are common, e.g. Priamus Pria-
mides, Italus Italia, etc.‚ but these afford little authority for such a violent
double change in two consecutive lines as we have here. For cases where
poets intentionally vary the accent, and so the quantity, of a repeated word
cf. 1. 32. 11 n. 11. ludo . . . ‘worn out with play and (weighed down)
with sleep.’ An inaccurate but perfectly lucid expression, copied from Hom.
Il. 10. 98 καμάτῳ ἀδδηκότες ἠδὲ καὶ ὕπνῳ. For position of que of. 2. 19. 28 n.

13. mirum quod foret omnibus, ‘ so that it was a marvel to all . . .
how (line 17)1 slept . . . how . . .' 14. nidum. Because the town was
situated like a ‘nest' high up among the rocks ; it ‘nestled ' among them.
Acherontia, Bantia and Forentum are all small places near Horace's birthplace.
16. humilis, ‘low-lying.' 17. ut . . . dormirem, ut . . . These
clauses explain ‘mirum quod in line 13, a clause with ul being frequently
employed to explain a neuter pronoun, such as hoc, illud, quod, etc.‚ but ut
here also partly depends on mirum. atris, ⁶ deadly‚' cf. 1. 37. 27 11. 18.
sacra . . . myrto. 'ime ‘ laurel ' sacred to Apollo, and the ‘myrtle ' to
Venus, are symbolic of his future career as the poet who should sing the
praises of love : Apollo and Venus are marked out as his tutelar deities (cf.
. non sine olis). 20. non . . . infans, ‘not without heaven's favour a
poetic child‚' ie. by heaven’s special favour (litotes; cf. 1. 18. 9 n.) All
editors give animosus: ‘ courageouS‚’ but it is hard to see what ‘ courage ' an
infant shows who wanders into the woods and when tired out lies down and
falls asleep, or why Horace should allude to his ‘courage ' here at all. On
the other hand animus (cf. ἄνεμος, anima and inspirare, afflare) is used of
‘ inspiration‚’ as in Virg. Aen. 6. 11 maynam cui ‘mentem animumque Ι Delius
inspirat vates, As therefore animosus: ‘ possessing animus‚' why may not
its meanings vary with the meaning of animus’, so that it here: ‘ possessing
