comes exterior is like our ‘ to give a person the wall‚' and teqere latus,
claudere latus may also be so rendered: but that is not the origin of
1110 Latin expression, which is to go on the left-hand side of a person:
so Acron here, and the schol. on JUV. 3. 131 (divitis hic servi claudit
latus inqenuorum Ι filius) explains claudit latus 03 = in sinistra ambulat.
As the right hand carries the weapon the left side is unprotected, and it was
a mark of respect and politeness to take it. 18. The ne in such a phrase
as utne tegam properly belongs to iubes, or some other verb understood:
cf. Ter. And. 1. 5. 28 eine eqo ut adverser. Dama was a common name for a
slave: see 1. 6. 38. spurcus, ‘filthyj is often applied to people of base
position: ef. Varro ap. Non. 4. 425 ne quis lictorem spurcum hmninem liberum
prehendere iussisse velit. 19. me gessi: exactly=our ‘I bore myself.'
certans melioribus: a reminiscence of the Homeric κρείσσοσιν ἶφι μάχε-
σθαι Il. 21. 486. melioribus is dat, Epod. 2. 203 Virg. Ecl. 5. 8 tibi certat
Amyntac. 20. hoc: sc. latus Damae tecere. 21. et quondam maiora
tuli: from Hom. Od. 20. -17 στῆθος δὲ πλήξας κραδίην ἠνίπαπε μύθῳ · Ι τέτλαθι
δή, κραδίη· καὶ κύντερον ἄλλο ποτ’ ἔτλης.

22. mam, ‘serape ' or ‘rake 'together’ ; cf. rutrum, a hoe, and Lucil. 901
‘racis haec (hoc MSS.) et colliyis omnia furtim, and so of the sea raking up as it
were its saud in 0 3101111, Lucr. 6. 726. The familiar and easy metaphor of a
farmer hoeing a hill round his roots is at the bottom of the word; corruere
divitias is thus used, Plaut. Rud. 2. 6. 58. 011 1110 other hand Virg. G. 1.
105 cumulos ruit is to ‘rake down.' 25. praeroso hamo, ‘ having taken
the bait off the end of the hook ²: cf. praerodere diyitos Plaut. Ps. 3. 2. 93.
prae has this force in praeuro, to burn at 1110 end, praeacuo, praecido etc.
captatores are often compared to anglers; 300 Mayor 011 JuV. 12. 123 who
refers 10 Lucian, Dial. Mort. 6. 4, where a young captator aged thirty com-
plains to Pluto that the old man past ninety (to whom he had made many
valuable presents), after swallowing so large a bait (τοσοῦτόν μοι δέλεαρ
καταπιών), had come to 1113 funeral and crowed over him: cf. Mart. 6. 63. 5
numera ‘mayna quidem misit sed misit in hamo. 26. artem, ‘ your cun-
ning ' as an angler, rather than your ‘profession,' as 010111 takes it: though
Seneca (see Introduction) speaks of the ars, i.e. profession of legacy-hunters ε
Lucian, Dial. Mort. 6. 3, calls their trade καινήν τινα τέχνην.

27. 100, ‘case,’ ef. 1. 9. 41. 28. inprobUS, ultro and audax are
all parts of the same idea: the hardened villain, who will have the impudenee
10 drag his betters into court, when he himself should be the subject of prose-
cution‚ for this is the force - of ultro. 30. priorem=meliorem. 31.
fecunda coniunx: cf. Juv. 5. 137 dominus tamen et domini reae Ι si
vis tu fieri, nullus tibi parvidus aula Ι luserit Aeneas, nec filia dulcior illo.
32. Quinte . . . Publi: slaves had no praenomina, but received one on
manumission3 Pers. 5. 78 verterit hunc dominus, momento turbinis eocit Ι

cassa nuce te pauperet, ‘rob you of an empty nut ’ς i.e. something
worthleSS‚ cf. Plaut. Ps. 1. 3. 152 amatorem inanem, quas-i cassam nucem.
MSS. here have the spelling quassa. pauper-0 comes from the language of
everyday life3 it 13 used by Plautus several times, and with an abl. as here
=frag. ap. Non. 157, 7 quam eyo tanta pauperavi per dolum pecunia.
