resolution. ‘No ordinary (litotes, cf. Od. 1. 18. 9 n.) potions shall make thee
hurry back to me, O Varus, thou that art soon to smart severely for this, and
not summoned by Mai-sian spells (cf. 17. 29 3 Virg. Aen. 7. 758) shall thy
heart retum (to me) z something more powerful will I prepare, a more power-
sul draught will I administer to thee in thy pride.’ She means that giving up
ordinary means she will kill the boy to prepare a draught ; hence his outburst,
line 83. Porphyrion takes nec vocata . . . ‘nor shall thy (sane) mind ever
return to thee though recalled by Marsian spells,’ but redibit is clearly parallel
to recurres and so ad me must be supplied with it. 74. caput can be applied
to a person in emotional language (e. 9. of hate, affection, mirth)‚ and so
commonly infandum, carum, festivum caput, and in Gk. ὦ φίλον, σκληρὸν κάρα.
fleturum = cf. Gk. κλαίωνε ‘to your cost,' κλαύσει, ‘ you will pay for it!

83. Sub haec, ‘thereupon ’: sub with acc. is sometimes ‘Just after’ as
well as ‘just before.' 84. lenire: historic inf. used dramatically. 85.
sed . . . ‘ but doubtful whence to break the silence (i. e. not knowing with
what words to begin in his despair) he hurled forth a Thyestean curse,' zle.
one like that of Thyestes, when he cursed his brother Atreus, for serving up
to him at a meal the flesh of his sons, cf. Aesch. Ag. 1560 seq.

87. venena . . . (1) magio rites (can change the) great (laws of) right
and wrong, (but) cannot change human retribution,' πλε. though they may be
able to murder him and so confound the great laws of right and wrong (cf.
Soph. Ant. 797 τῶν μεγάλων θεσμῶν : Virg. G. 1. 505 fas versum atque nefas),
yet they cannot render idle that human vengeance (cf. Od. 1. 28. 32 vices
superbae) which he immediately proceeds to threaten them with. So most
take this perplexing passage, supplying convertere valent with the first clause 3
cf. Cic. ad Att. 10. 1. The construction, however, is very doubtful, while
it is certainly harsh to speak of magio rites as able to prevail over everlasting
laws of right and wrong, but unable to prevail over mere human vengeance.
(2) Taking humanam vicem adverbially (see vicem in Dict.) ‘magio cannot
confound the laws of right and wrong as if they were human things.' The
words which follow, however, show that vicem is here ‘retribution.' (3)
Haupt’s conjecture ‘maya nou is largely adopted, ‘magio drugs cannot change
right and wrong, cannot change . . .' (4) It is possible to make mayuum
s. u. a parenthical exclamation, ‘ magic rites—great are the (or ‘ Ο great ²)
laws of right and wrong—cannot change human retribution.'

89. diris: abl. of dirae, ‘curses.' agam, ‘pursue.' 94. deorum
Manium. Cf. the regular inscription on tombstones D.M. :dis Manibus.
They represent the ‘spirit’ or ‘ghost ' of the departed, and as such have
‘power ' (vis) to haunt his murderers. 100. Esquilinae. Part of the
Esquiline hill ontside the walls was a common burying-ground for the poorest
of the poor, cf. S. 1. 8. 8-13. The witches are to be flung out here unburied
for carrion-birds to seed on, while the boy’s parents gloat over the spectacle.
For the hiatus ⁸in the final syllable (probably with shortening) before alites
cf. S. 1. 9. 38 sime amas; Virg. Aen. 3. 211 insulae Ionio.
