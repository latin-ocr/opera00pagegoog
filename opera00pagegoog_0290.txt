of Cannae) nefastus dies was gradually used for ⁴ a day of evil omen,' a usage
which would be encouraged by the tendency to connect the word with nefas
rather than vce-sari. Cf. 1. 35. 35 nefasti=‘guilt‚' and see Dict. s. v.

5. et, ‘even.’ crediderim, ‘I can well believe.' The perfect subj. of
verbs of ‘believing’ or ‘affirming’ is elegantly used to express a certain
diffidence in asserting a belief or making an affirmation. The Roman

writers felt that for fallible men such words as credo, affiwno, dico, were not ·

to be used lightly, and loved to modify them in such phrases as credi-
derim, paee tua dixerim, hoe pro certo affirmaverim. 6. penetralia,

The horror is increased by the addition of the epithet nocturnus, 8.
venena Colcha. Some MSS. read Colchica, but an open vowel at the end
of one stanza before a vowel at 1116 00111111611061116111 of the next, though objec-

tionable where there 13 110 pause, is better than the very harsh elision which
Colchica involves. Colchus is analogous in form to such adjectives as Medus,

13. quid quisque . . . horas, ‘no man has ever been sufficiently
guarded, hour by hour, what he personally is to avoid.’ cautum est is
used impersonally, ‘it has been guarded by a man. ' quid vitet is the
direct question quid vitem? put as a dependent clause3 quisque 13 added

the result too often is that while A carefully avoids Ο, and B, D, yet D turns
out to be what A, and O what B should have avoided, or some unregarded
force Ε 1111113 both alike. Cf. lines 15- 20. 14. Bosphorum. For the
dangers of the Bosphorus cf. 3. 4. 30 ; at its entrance were the so-called Sym-
plegades 01 Clashing RockS. What the ‘Carthaginian sailor’ is doing there
need not trouble us: Horace merely remembers that in the days when
Carthage existed its seamen were bold and venturesome, and he mentions the
Bosphorus quite vaguely as a type of any dangerous strait. Moreover, he is

the Parthian' because the flight was only a manoeuvre which enabled them
to discharge their arrows without danger into 11133363 of infantry who could
not follow them, cf. 1. 19. 11 11. 19. robur. A dungeon in the Mamer-
