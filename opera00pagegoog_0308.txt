<suggests an antithesis with the simplicity of early Rome. Cf. 2. 15. 14-20.
47. permutem, ‘take in exchange.’· 48. divitias operosior-es, ‘the
greater burden of wealth.’

for life. Observe the emphatic alliteration in this line, and in 13, 16, 32.

6. illum . . . ‘him (i.e. such a youth a's I have described) from the foeman’s
walls let the wife of a warring emperor behold and her full-grown daughter

though matrona and viryo both form the nom. to suspiret (2. 13. 38 n.),
yet the clause eheu . . . suspiret expresses only the feelings of the ‘maiden.’
9. eheu : dramatic and vivid after suspiret. rudis agminum Sponsus,
‘her betrothed unskilled in combats.' ‘rudis takes a gen. of ignorance, cf. 1.
