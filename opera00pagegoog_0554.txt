1. 93 si poteris (sc. liber) vacuo tradi, si cuncta videbis Ι mitia, si vires fregerit
ira suas. 4. ne pecces ε ‘(I say this) lest you blunder ' ; ne final. 5.
sedulus ‘ officious' ε cf. 2. 1. 260 3 S. 1. 5. 71. opera vehemente, ‘by

your impetuous zeal.’ 6. uret, ‘ galle,' ef. 1. 10. 43. sarcina: the
quantity of the i is to be accounted for by the fact that sareio has also the
shorter stem sareu chartae: ‘In Catullus' days the Romans used only

papyrus, never parchment, for a regular liber or volumen. Books made up
like ours and‘written on parchment seem to have come into use about Martial's
time '—Munro on Catullus 53. 7. perferre like abieito has for its obJect
sarcinam, not clitellas. 'Po quo supply the antecedent ibi, to go with inpingas,
⁸ dash down.' 8. ferus, ‘ wildly,’ like an unbroken animal. 9. fabula,
‘ the talk of the town ' : cf. Epod. 11. 8 sabula quanta sui.

10-19. Push on to Rome: but olon’t carry my boola like a elomn, a drunlcen
slave-yisrl, or a humble quest .· nor tell every one that you are on your way to
Caesar. Take qood care of it. 10. lamas: lacunas maiores, continentes
aquam pluviam sen caelestem, ἀπὸ τοῦ λαιμοῦ, quae inqluvies est et vorayo
viarum sen fossae fluviorum. hinc qnoque diotae sunt Lamiae puerorum vora-
trices. Ennius: silvarum saltus, latebras lamasque lutosas—Comm. Cruq. The
derivation which he suggests is of course absurd ε ffima is for lae-ma (cs. lana
sor lue-na, examen for way-men, limus for lio-mus), while Lamia (A. P. 340)
ΞΛάμια. 13 akin to λαμυρός ‘greedy.’ The word is found nowhere else except
in Festus, and seems to have belonged to the popular dialect. ‘Push on
stoutly over hills, streams and bogs.’ 11. victor propositi, ‘achieving
your purpose,' ἐγκρατὴς τοῦ σκοποῦ : ⁶ But when you’ve quell’d the perils of
the road’—Con. 12. sic . . . ne: A. P. 152; Roby 1650, S. G. 684.
13. rusticus agnum: imayinem ridiculam propter continuas bestiolae motus et
curam hominis ne in solum desiliat, ne ab ipso fortasse laedatur—Or. 14.
Pyrria or the corrupted Pirria is the reading of all MSS. collated by Keller.
Most editors have adopted the form Pyrrhia, but as Lachmann (on Lucret.
p. 408) first remarked neque Graecae neque Romanae feminae nomen est. The
derivation of the word is unknown, but the name of a male slave, Pyrria, in
the Andria of Terence seems a corruption of Πυρρίας, which occurs in Aristo-
phanes and elsewhere, and is derived from πύρρος, ‘red.’ The Scholiasts tell
us that Pyrria was the name of an aneilla in a play by Titinius, who stole a
ball of wool, but being drunk at the time, carried it 30 clumsily that she was
easily detected. 15. tribulis properly means a man of the same tribe,
and perhaps it is best taken so here, the notion being that a wealthy man at
Rome has invited to dinner a poor member of the same tribe, living in the
country, doubtless with a view to his vote and interest. But as the tribus
came to be used in contrast with the equites and the Senate (cf. Mart. 8. 15.
3 dat populus, dat ‚oratus eques, dat tura Senatus, et ditant Latias tertia dona
tribus) 30 tribulis acquired the meaning of plebeiant cf. Mart. 9. 50. 7 of a toga
nune anus et tremulo vix accipienda tribuli, ib. 58. 8.· Hence it is possible
that this may be the meaning here z but we have noevidence of this force of
the word in the time of Horace. The humble guest comes bringing under his
arm the dress-shoes (soleae) in which he would be expected to appear in the
dining·room, although he would put them off when he took his place at table
(S. 2. 8. 77), and the felt cap which he would need when he wont home at
night. He cannot afford to come in a litter, nor even to have a slave to attend
upon him. 16. ne has far more support than neu. ne narres is most
simply taken as. imperative, cf. S. 2. 3. 88 and perhaps line 4 above. Some,
however, prefer ne narres . . . nitere, ‘ that you may not say . . . keep
