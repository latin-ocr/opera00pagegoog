Pomm». NOTES 601

Prometheus of Aeschylus. Orestes was tristis during his exile after the
murder of his mother, as in Aesch.'s Eumenides, and Eur.'s Orestes and Iph. Taur.

126. ad imum, ‘to the last' as in line 152. 128. proprie com-
munia dicere, ‘to give individua] sbape to common types of human char-
acter.' communia covers all general and abstract notionS, such as anger,
cruelty, cowardice and the like3 and proprie dicere is: ‘to give a concrete
character to,' zze. to embody in consistent and vivid pictures of individuale
Kiessling quotes the heading of a chapter in Hermogenes the rhetorician πῶς
κοινὰ διανοήματα. ἰδιώσομεν ; 129. deducis: the tense and mood of the
verb (especially in contrast with proferres and in connexion with the emphatic
tu) require us to suppose that one of the Pisos was already engaged upon a
tragedy based upon the Iliad. The metaphoris the familiar one from spinning ;
cf. Ep. 2. 1. 225. Aristotle (Poet. 23) says that the Iliad aud the Odyssey
furnish material for one or at most two tragedies each, while several could be
made from Cyclic poems such as the Little Iliad or the Cypria.

131. publica materies, πλε. themes already handled, which can be made
all a poet’s own, by originality of treatment. 132. vilem patulumque
orbem, ‘ the cheap and easy round ’ of the mode of treatment previously
adopted. There is probably also in orbis a reference to the ‘ cyclic ² style of
mimicking Homer, cf. Pollianus, Anth. Pal. 1. 130 τοὺς κυκλίους τούτους τοὺς
“ αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα. ” λέγοντας Ι μισῶ, λωποδύτας ἀλλοτρίων ἐπέων. 133. verbo
verbum reddere: the earlier Roman dramatists often did little more than
translate very closely their Greek originals. Ennius ay. translates almost
literally Eur. Med. 502 seq. in his Medea, frag. 10. 134. desilies 111 artum,
‘plunge into a place where you will be cramped.' A writer who begins by
copying too closely a Greek original either in treatment, or in diction, will soon
find that he is as it were working in setters. 135. pudor: the copyist
will either be ashamed to abandon a method which he has once adopted ; or
if not, he will find that it is impossible to deviate from the line which 116 has
taken up, without falling into incongruity.

136-152. nec . . . incipies: Horace appears to pass here, by one of his
rapid transitions so common 111 this epistle, from the drama to the epos, to
which indeed the cautious of the last five lines are almost as applicable as to
the drama itself. cyclicus: the ‘cyclic poets ’ were those epic poets‚ who,
probably after the Iliad and Odyssey had assumed their present form, wrote
upon various legends, more 01· less closely connected with the Theban and
TroJan wars. They did not, as has been erroneously supposed, intentionally
write a cycle of poems; but the grammarians put together by their aid a cycle
of legends. The most noteworthy were Stasinus, Arctinus, Leschea Agias and
Eugammon. Τ116 poet to whom Horace here refers, has not been identified,
and probably he had no particular writer in view, but is censui-ing the lack of
simplicity in the school as a whole. In that case olim=aliquand0. The 11116,
it is to be noted, contains nothing in itself too high-flown, but, though not
extravagant in itselfi yet it contrasts unfavourably with the modest and un-
assuming tone of Homer's introduction. 138. feret, ‘produce ⁹: hiatu,
‘mouthing.' 139. parturient, the reading of all MSS„ for which Bentley
read parturiunt, urging that verbs in -urio have even in the present a future
force (parturio -- ⁶ am about to bring forth ’). But parturient may be defended,
as parallel to incipies of line 136 ‘if you do begin so, it will be a case of
