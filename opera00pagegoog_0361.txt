13. laetie, ‘luxuriant' caprea, ‘a roebuck,' but capra ‘a she-goat.’
14. fulvae . . . leonem, ⁴ a lion just weaned from his tawny mother's
udder.' So most editors, but matris ab ubere lacte depulsus is extremely
harsh, and the harshness is not got rid of by saying that lacte depulsus is
virtually one word: ἀπογαλακτισθέντα, ‘ weaned.' Nauck and Kiessling seem
rightly to join caprea pascuis intenta matris ab ubere : the young roebuck‚ that
has just turned from its mother’s udder to seek the pastum, suddenly finds
itself face to face with the newly-weaned lion, as it seeks its prey: the com-
parison is certainly very complete. fulvae then refers to the colour of ‘red
deer.' 16. dente, ‘soon to perish beneath its (as yet) unfleshed teeth.'

17. Raetis, ‘Raetian’ ; for proper nouns used as adjectives cf. l. 15. 10 n.
and below Metaurumflumen. For Raetia or Rhaetia (the modern Tyrol) see
Class. Dict. Raeti has nearly all MSS. authority, but the expression Raeti
Vindelici is intolerable. 18. Vindelici: inhabited a district S. of the
Danube and to the N. of the Raeti. quibus mos . . . ‘to whom whence
the custom is derived which through all time arms their right hands with an
Amazonian axe, I have deferred inquiring‚ nor indeed is it permissible to
know all things? This remarkable parenthesis seems intended to give local
colouring and an appearance of reality. The artifice produces lan effect
almost as natural as the introduction of an elaborately painted insect into the
foreground of a boldly treated landscape, while the bathos of the conclusion
nee scirefas est omnia transcends criticism. Many critics cut out all from quibus
to sed, and sense and metre are thus left intact. Such lines, with their recondite
allusion to a small point of antiquarian lore and their parody of Horatian
philosophy in line 22, are just such as a copyist might have interpolated.

22. sed, ‘but‚' i.e. to resume, ‘however’z so in Greek, δ’ οὖν. 23.
victrices . . . ‘conquering bordes conquered in their turn by the plans (i.e.
strategy) of a youth.’ 24. iuvenis. He was 23 years old. 25.
sensere, ‘ felt to their cost‚' cf. 2. 7. 10 11. mene, ⁴ mens ad virtutes in-
telliyeniiaa sagacitatem, prudentiam, indoles ad animi virtutes, fortitudinem,
clementiam, fidem pannea—Orelli. rite, sc. nutrita, ‘ what a mind (duly
nurtured), what a disposition duly nurtured beneath an auspicious roos could
effect! rite, faustis, and penetralibus are all religious words designedly used
to suggest the almost gpdlike qualities of Augustus. 27. quid. Augusti . . .:
these words specialise and so explain the yeneral language of the preceding
lines : ‘ yea, what Augustus could do for the N eros!

29. fortes . . . z the mention of Augustus’ care and the great name of
the Nerones leads Horace to develop the two chief ideas of the Ode, (1) in
lines 29-32 the necessity of hereditat-y quahties, (2) 111 lines 33-36 the neces-
sity of good education to develop them: he then illustrates the former at
length in lines 37-72, and briefly alludes to the second in lines 73-76. This
disproportion in the length of treatment is natural ε 1110 advantages of educa-
tion afford little scope for a lyric rhapsody3 while the mention of great
ancestors gives opportunity for introducing a brilliant historical fiction. Suet.
(Tib. 1) says that by ‘Nero ' siqnificatur linqua Sabim fortis ac strenuus,
so that the connexion Nerones fortes may be designed. fortibus : abl.
of origin. 31. inbellem feroces, aquilae columbam ε notice the juxta-
position of the contrasted adjectives and nouns. Cf. 2. 4. 6 n. 33. vim in-
sitam, ‘native force.' 35. mores. Usually: ‘character‚' ‘ behaviour,'
but here obviously some active principle of the same sort as doctrina (⁶ educa-
