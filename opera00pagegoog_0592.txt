poet: as in C. S. 75. blandus: cf. Od. 4. 1. 8 blandae iuvenum preces ;
3. 23. 18 non sumptuosa blandior hostia ‚· 1. 24. 13 Threicio blandius Orpheo.
'Phe notion is that of winning favour by entreaty. 138. Manes, here ‘the
gods of the lower wo1·ld,’ not the shades of the departed: cf. Virg. Aen. 12.
646 vos 0 mihi Manes Ι este boni, quoniam superis aversa voluntas; G. 4. 505
quo fletu Manes, qua numina voce moveret? The word meaning originally
‘the good ones’ (Preller, Rom. Myth. 73, 455 ; Curt. Gr. Etym. 1. 408), it is
applied primarily to the spirits of ancestors‚ worshipped as still powerful for
good over the fortunes of their descendants, and then to all the deities of the
lower world, among whom these came to be reckoned.

139-160. Poetry had its rise ‘tuith us in the rustic merry-malcinys (gf liar·
vest, and tlte jests bandiecl to ancl fro, at first innocent, but afterwards yrowinq
scurrilous‘. leen this rouyli style of verse was ehecked by law ,· but it was
only acquaintance with the literature of Greece which banished the earlier
coarse·ness. 139. fortes, ‘stout fellows ’ : ef. S. 2. 2. 115 fortem colonum ‚-
Virg. G. 2. 472 patiens operum exiyuoque adsueta iuventus of· the inhabitants
of the country. 140. condita, post frumenta: so Aristotle (Nic. Eth.
8. 9. 5) finds the source of the earliest festivals in harvest—homes, when men
met together τιμὰς ἀπονέμοντες τοῖς θεοῖς, καὶ αὑτοῖς ἀναπαύσεις πορίζοντες
μεθ’ ἡδονῆς. 142. pueris et coniuge, in apposition to sociie
operum: the wife and children are the partners of his toils, slavery being
regarded as unknown in those good old days, 143. Tellurem: of
the twelve gods of ‘husbandmen ’ mentioned by Varro (R. R. 1. 1. 4) the
first pair are Jupiter and Tellus. Roughly carved altars to Silvanus are
not uncommon: several such have been found in England, one of which
records the slaying of a great wild boar which had defied earlier 1111111615.
porco should strictly be porca, but porcus is really epicene 3 cf. Cato, R. R.
134 porco femina. lacte ι milk is offered to Priapus in Virg. Ecl. 7. 33.
piabant = pie colebant, or more exactly pium (i.e. propitium) faciebant.
144. Genium: cf. 1. 7. 94 n.; A. P. 209. memorem: the geniuS, re-
membering how brief is the life of the man, with whom his own is bound up,
desires to be merry as long as he can.

145. Fescennina licentia: Livy (7. 2) 111 describing the origin of
dramatic representations at Rome says vernaculis artificibus quia ister Tusco
verbo ludio vocabatur, nomen histrionibus inclitum .· qui non, sicut ante, Fes-
cennino versu similem incompositum temere ac rudem alternis iaciebant, sed
impletas modis saturas descripto iam ad tibicinem cantu motuque congyruenti
peragyebant. The original Fescennine verses therefore consisted of a rude and
extempore exchange of repartees. Paul. Diae. (p. 85 Miill.) gives two derivatione

of the word ι Fescennini versae, qui canebantur in nuptiis, ex urbe Fescennina ·

dicuntur allati, sive ideo dicti, quia fascinum putabantur arcere. There was
an Etruscan town Fescennia or Fescennium 011 1116 Tiber, near Falerii,
and the unquestioned connexion of the Atellan plays with Atella in
Campania seems to lend some support to this local origin of the term.
But on the whole the second explanation is to be preferred, though not quite
in the form given (from Festus) by Paulus. ¹fascinum denotes primarily the
evil eye, but as this was supposed 1ο 116 averted by the use of an obscene
symbol, fascinum came to be a synonym for the symbol itself3 and as the
effects of the evil eye were especially to be dreaded in marriage the chanting
of obscene verses was considered an essentia] part of the nuptial ceremony,
and it was almost solely in this connexion that the Fescennine verses survived
