506 , HORACE BOOK 1

Latin. 13. ob heredis curam: cf. Od. 4. 7. 10. The bitterness with
which the prospect of wealth passing to an heir was viewed was naturally
increased by the childlessness so common at this time at Rome. AugustuS‚
Maecenas, Horace, and Virgil all left no son: cf. Pind. Ol. 11. 88 ἐπεὶ πλοῦτος
ὁ λαχὼν ποιμένα Ι ε’πακτὸν’ἀλλότριον Ι θνάσκοντι στυγερώτατος. 14. adsidet,
‘is next door to.’ The word seems used nowhere else in this sense. 15. vel
inconsultum-‘a madman, if you will’ z cf. Od. 2. 7. 28 ; 3. 19. 18 ; 4. 12. 28.

16-20. Wiue hus wonderful power to open the beart, to ’ναίεις the spirits

and ιο quieken the wite. 16. dissignat: unquestionably right, as better ¹

supported than desiyuat, and as the rarer word being more likely to be cor-
rupted. dissiynare is properly ‘to break the seal,' hence 6 to open.’ operta,
‘the secrets of the heart ’ : cf. 1. 18. 38 ; A. Ρ. 434 ; S. 1. 4. 89 ; Plat..Sy1np.
217 Ε εἰ μὴ πρῶτον μὲν τὸ λεγόμενον οἶνος ἄνευ τε παίδων καὶ μετὰ παίδων ἦν
ἀληθής, Theocr. 29. 1. 2. Compare the proverbs in vino veritas and οἶνος
καὶ παῖδες ἀληθεῖς. 1'7. Spes: cf. Ar. Eth. Nic. 3. 8. 13 ἀλλ’ οἱ μὲν
ἀνδρεῖοι διὰ τὰ προειρημένα θαρραλέοι . . . τοιοῦτον δὲ ποιοῦσι καὶ οἱ μεθυσκό-
μενοι· εὐέλπιδες γὰρ γίγνονται. inertem, ‘coward' (Od. 3. 5. 36 11.),
common in the language of the camp as contrasted with strenuus miles .· cf. l.
11. 28 and Tac. Hist. 1. 46 iners pro strenuo: hence much better than the
reading inermem, the point being the inspiriting power of wine, not the follies
which it can cause. Our ‘Dutch courage.' 18. addocet: only here
and Cic. Cluent. 37. 104 addocti iudices‘, the ad being intensive, or denoting
increase and progress3 Roby 1833-4. 19. fecundi, ‘teeming' like our
own ‘flowing bowl ' ε or perhaps ‘ pregnant,’ like our ‘ pregnant wit! facundi,
which has good MS. support, would lead to an intolerable tautology with
disertos. 20. contracta, ‘ cramped.’

21-31. I 20er take care that all is in qood order, aud that the queste are
well chosen, so zet nothing] keep you away. 21. imperor, 6 Ι charge myself,’
apparently with the reflexive force of the passive. For the rare use of verbs
which govern the dat. in pass. cf. A. P. 56 iuvideor3 Munro, Lucr. 2. 156.
22. turpe, ‘ dirty.’ toral, ‘hangings ' in front of the couch, quickly soiled
with falling bits etc.: cf. S. 2. 4. 84 n. For the form cf. capital, cervical.
23. conruget nares, ‘ make you tuQr nose ' in disgust. ne non . . .
ostendat, 6 that . . . fail not to sth you.' 24. ne fidos . . . cf. the ‘catch'
in Mart. 1. 27. 7 μισ-ὢ μνάμονα συμπόταν. 25. eliminet, ‘carry abroad‚’ a
word used in the early poets in a literal sense, and here in a somewhat
more extended application: cf. Pomponius in Non. 38 vos istic manete: elimi-
nabo extra aedes coniuyem. The force of the English derivative seems to be
due to mathematicians of a later age.

26. iungaturque pari: for as Seneca (Ep. 19) say-3, ante conspiciendum cum
quibus edas et bibas, quam quid edas et bibas, Butram . . . Septiciumque,
unknown persons, friends of Torquatus. 27. cena prior, ‘ an earlier en-
gagement.² potiorque puelia, 6 a girl whom he prefers ': -que appears here to
have the force of coupling asternatives, which are regarded as both acting to
prevent his presence, though not together 3 hence it is virtually disjunctive, as
in Virg. G. 2. 87, 139, 3123 3. 121 (Conington), and often in Lucretius (cf.
Munro's index): the engagement is not necessarily to the puella, though it
may be. Martin rightly renders ‘ unless 116 be engaged elsewhere or flirting '
' with some girl whom he prefers to any company! 28. adsumam, ‘ I will
have S. t00.' Almost all MSS. have ad summam. umbris, ‘guests whom you
may bring ’ t the umbrae were guests not invited by the host, but brought by
