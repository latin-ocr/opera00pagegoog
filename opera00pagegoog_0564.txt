536 HORACE BOOK 1

are the positive enactments or ‘statutes ⁹ of the comitia centuriata, with which
the plebiscita of the comitia tributa dame to be practically identical: ius is
‘law ' in its widest sense, iura being either the various component parts of
ius, or ‘rules of law,’ legal provisions, either contained in the XII Tables,
or added by the praetors. Cf. Gaius 1. 2 constant autem iura populi Romani
ex lembus, plebis consultis, constitutionibus principum, edictis eorum qui ius
edicendi liabent, responsis prudentium. 42. iudice: in private suits a
single iudea: decided questions of fact, after a praetor had put the case into
the proper form for hearing, and settled any question of law involved. 43.
res sponsore: aa MSS. except vet. Bland. have responsore, but responsor is
never used for qui iura respondet, and if it waS, the word would be out of
place here, for a good man is not required to be a learned lawyer. On the
other hand sponsor is the regular word for one who stands as surety, and thus
secures a man his property3 cf. Corn. Nep. Att. 9 ipsi autem Fulviae tanta
diligentia officium suum praestitit, ut nultum stiterit vadimonium sine Attico,

sponsor omnium rerum fiherit. 44. vicinia ε the people of the same quarter
or vicus3 1. 17. 62; S. 2. 5. 106.

46-56. Α man may possess some merits without possessiny aa, and lie may
be kept from sin only by the sear of detection. 47. loris non ureris: cf.
Epod. 4. 3. Ibericis peruste funibus. 49. bonus et frugi, ⁴ bonus servus
honesta sequitur, fruyi domino utilia ²—Ritter. negitatque is unques-
tionably right, although many good MSS. have carelessly enough neqat atque.
Sabellus: Porphyrion says this means Horace himself, being: ‘a plain Sabine
like myself.' Lachmann takes it as = ‘a man who speaks his mind,' any one who
is plain and straightforward like a Sabine. 50. foveam, ‘ the pitfall ’ ε Α.
Ρ. 459. Cicer0, Phil. 4. 5. 12, compares Antonius to an inmanis tetraque belua
quae in foveam incidit. 51. opertum: sc. esca ; cf. 1. 7. 74. miluus,
a dactyl, as in Epod. 16. 32, and always in Plautus and Phaedrus 3 the trochaic
scansion appears first in Pers. 4. 26. The ‘kite-fish ’ is mentioned by Pliny,
H. N. 9. 26. 82, along with the hirundo as a flying fish.

53. til is anybody, not Quinctius in particular nor the slave addressed.
in te added because of the indefiniteness of nihil: with a more definite object

like scelus, dedecus, facinus, it would not have been used. 54. eit, jussive :
cf. Mart. 8. 56. 5 sint Maecenates, non deerunt, Flacce, flIarones. miscebis,
‘you will make no difference between’: cf. A. P. 397. 55. unum: sc.

modium: the suggested tanam would involve a ridiculous exaggeration. 56.
no'n facinus: Horace is not adopting the Stoic paradox that all sins are
equal, which he ridicules in S. 1. 3. 96; but he simply asserts that if the
extent of the pilfering is limited only by the sear of detection, this does not
affect the character of the act, a view in which there is nothing paradoxical.

57-62. One who is virtuous to outward appearance may clierisli evil desires
in secret. 57. omne forum : not ‘all the fora,' but like omnis domus in
line 44, ‘the whole forum! At the date of this Epistle the forum Auyusti
was probably not finished, and only the forum Romanum and the small forum
Iulium were in use. There were several tribunalia in the forum, but the vir
bonus would only attract the eyes of those around the one, at which he hap-
pened ⁵to be acting at the time as iudea. 59. clare: Martial (1. 39. 6)
quotes among the signs of a good man nihil arcano qui royet ore deos ,· and
the rule of Pythagoras was μετὰ φωνῆς εὔχεσθαι. This passage of Horace is
imitated by Pers. 2. 3-16 3 and in ovid, Fast. 5. 675-690, a merchant is repre·
