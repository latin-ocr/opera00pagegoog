am ready to hymn to heaven thy chastity aud virtue, iu α palinodo such as that

upon thy liueaye there is uo stur, thou hast never violated α tomb, Pactumeius

CANIDIA. ‘ Thou dost appeal to deas ears, Art thou to be unpum'shed for
revealin9 my mysteries anot makiuy me the talk of the town? (53-59). Is it
for that I have studied witchcraftZ No: thou shalt live to suffer eudless
tormeuts like the tormeuts of the damued (60-69). Thou shaZt seek to stay
thysels, but iu vain, while I ride iu triumph ou thy neck. What! shall I,
who com work aa wonder-9, tament that my skill is ineffective against thee ‚2'

1. iam iam. Eager repetition, cf. solve, solve, line 7. do manus,
‘yield‚' ‘acknowledge defeat.’ 3. Dianae: cf. 5. 51 n. non mo-
venda, ‘ inviolable,' ἀκίνηταε both movere and κινεῖν are especially used of
sacrilegious disturbance of things sacred. 4. libros . . . Cf. Acts xix.
19 ‘ Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together,
and burned them before all men.’ 5. refixa . . . Cf. 5. 45 n. refixa,
‘unfixed‚' cf. Od. 1. 28. 11 3 Virg. Aen. 5. 527 refixa sidera of shooting stars.
6. parco . . . ‘ cease from thy awful spells ' ; sacris is purposely ambiguous
=‘holy' or ‘accursed.' 7. turbinemz ῥόμβος, ‘a magio wheel,' used in
Theocr. 2. 17 with a wry—neck (ἴυγξ) fastened on it to draw a lover to the
house. The ‘letting it go back ' destroyed the charm. 8. Telephus.
Achilles, grandson of Nereus, as being the son of Thetis, wounded Telephus
king of the Mysians, and theu healed him, according to the oracle ὀ τρώσας
καὶ ἰάσεται, with the rust of the spear which wounded him.

11. unxere, ‘anointed ’3 part of the solemn ritual of burial (cf. 11. 18. 350
καὶ τότε δὴ λοῦσάν τε καὶ ἤλειψαν λίπ’ ἐλαίῳε Virg. Aen. 6. 219 corpusque
lavant frigentis et uuyuuut) and so in strong contrast with addictum . . .
cunibus. He received due burial although Achilles had ‘given him over' to
the fowls of the air and to the dogs‚ cf. 11. 23. 1823 Ἕκτορα δ’ οὔ τι Ι δώσω
Πριαμίδην πυρὶ δαπτέμεν, ἀλλὰ κύνεσσινε see too 1 Sam. xvii. 44 ‘I will give
thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field) 12. The
rhythm is most striking and possibly intended to convey a sense of horror.
homicidam H.: a poor rendering of Hom. H. 1. 242 Ἕκτορος ἀνδροφόνοιο.
14. heu emphasises the pitiable position of Priam at the feet of the slayer
of his son. The famous story of Priam begging back the body of Hector is
told in Il. 24. pervicacia, ‘ obstinate,' but still yielding in the end.
15. saetosa . . . ‘by Circe's favour put off (their swinish) limbs bristly
with hard hides! The crew of Ulysses drank of Circe’s enchanted cup and
were turned into swine‚ but retained their intelligence (Od. 10. 240 αὐτὰρ νοῦς
ἦν ἔμπεδος ὡς τὸ πάρος περ), which Horace, however, here supposes them to
lose ; cf. meus, line 17. 16. laboriosi: sense and rhythm make this go with
Ulixei, but cf. 16. 60. 17. sonus ‘(human) utterance.’ 20. institoribus.
‘ Pedlars ’ played a more important part in antiquity than theydo now, and
these travelling merchants with their costly wares (Sen. fr. de matr. 52
institores yemmarum sericarumque vestium si intromiseris, periculum est) were
dangerous to womanly virtue, cf. Od. 3. 6. 30. Of course the phrase ‘well—
beloved by sailors and pedlars ' is satirical.

21. fugit, reliquit, est, reclinat, urguet: excited asyndeton. vere-
cundus color, ‘the hue of modesty,’ the fresh colour of blushing youth. 22.
ossa . . . ⁴ my bones now covered with yellow hide ' ; cf. Theocr. 2. 89 ἔρρευν
δ’ ἐκ κεφαλᾶς πᾶσαι τρίχες, αὐτὰ δὲ λοιπὰ Ι ὀστί’ ἔτ’ ἦς καὶ δέρμα, where ὀστία
