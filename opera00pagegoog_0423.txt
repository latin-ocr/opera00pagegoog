SATIRE IV
A Desence ο] Horace's Satires from the charye ofmalcvolence. Diam, 38 13.c.

This Satire was written by Horace for the purpose of defending himself
and Satire from the charge of malevolence. He claims the same right to
castigate vice that the Greek poets of the Old Comedy arrogated to themselves,
1-5 ; the same right that Lucilius enjoyed, 6. The mention of Lucilius
introduces a slight digression, in which his rugged verse and diffuse and

poet ε indeed it is doubtful whether the writer of comedy deserves this title,
38-62 ; in the second place, you have got no right to charge my writings with
malevolence. I do not write for publication, 733 my object is not to give
pain, 77 3 I have as good a right to have a hearty laugh at the follies of my
neighbours as a wit at a dinner-table, 87. The scandal-monger‚ the backbiter,
are odjous characters, 94-1002 I have nothing in common with them. My
father taught me to mark other men's faults‚ for the purpose of avoiding them,
106-1263 I still carry on the practice, hence my immunity from the more
serious vices. I have faults of less 110111011311033; one of them is wasting paper
by writing‚ but you must allow me that privilege, or I and my brother poets
will make a proselyte of you by force.
