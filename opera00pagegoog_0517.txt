4. Veianius: Porphyrion writes nobilis qladiator post multas palmas
· consecratis Herculi Fundano armz's tande-m in ayellum se contulit : there seems
no positive evidence that gladiators were regarded as under the protection of
Hercules; but this god would be naturally selected by a gladiator. So a ·
soldier in Anth. Pal. 1. 241 writes: δέξαι μ’, Ἡράκλεις, Ἀρχεστράτου ἱερὸν
ὅπλον, Ι ὄφρα ποτὶ ξεστὰν παστάδα κεκλιμένα Ι ’γηραλέα τελέθοιμι. For the
dedication of the instruments of a profession on leaving it cf. Od. 3. 26 Intr.
6. extrema harena, ie. at the outside edge of the circus, under the podium,
where the more distinguished spectators had their seats. Veterans who had
received their discharge were sometimes induced to reappear on special
occasions (cf. Suet. Tib. 7 munus yladiatorium dedit, rudiariis quibusdam
revocatis auctoramento centenum milium). Veianius however, after his discharge,
retired altogether that he might not, after so many victories, break down and
be compelled again and again to appeal as a defeated combatant for the mercy
of the spectatorS. The desire that mercy should be shown to a defeated
gladiator was expressed by turning down the thumbs (Pliny, H. N. 28. 2. 5
pollices, cum faveamus, premere etiam proverbio iubemur: cf. 1. 18. 663 J uv. 3.
36, Mayor’s note). As exoro in itself is always ‘to prevail upon,' we must
here press the imperfect force of the present ‘ attempt to prevail upon ' : Roby
1454, 3, S. G. 591. 7. purgatam, ‘well rinsed‚’ for which purpose
vinegar was sometimes used ; cf. PerS. 5. 86. qui: for the ‘inner voice ’
cf. ib. 5. 96 stat eontra ratio et secretam yannit i‘n aurem. 8. sanus=si
sa is. 9. peccet, ‘ break down.’ ina ducat, ⁴ strain his panting
flaffiksss' ; cf. ilia W& 3. 507 ; Aen. 9. 415 lonqis singultibus ilia
pulsat ‚· Plin. Η. N. 26. 6. 15 iumentis . . . non tussientibus modo sed-ilia
quoque trahentibus .· all these phrases mean ‘ to become broken-winded.'

10. itaque: not found second in a sentence in prose before Livy. ludicra,
‘toy-s: i.e. trifleS‚ cf. 1. 6. 7. pono=depono‚ as sometimes even in Cicero,
agl. de Orat. 3. 12. 46; de Off. 3. 10. 433 and often, especially with arma,
in Livy. 11. quid verum: sc. sit, a rare omission in prose: cf. Cic. de
Off. 1. 43. 152 (Holden). For verum, ‘right' τὸ πρέπον, cf. 1. 12. 24; S.
2. 3. 312 ; idne est verum Ter. Andr. 3. 4. 5. It is not so much speculative
as moral truth of which. Horace is in quest. omnis in hoc sum, ‘ I am
wholly absorbed in this ' τ. cf. S. 1. 9. 2 lotus in illis. 12. condo et
compono, ‘ I store up and arrange,' so as to &a able to produce at once, like

a good condus promus

I find shelter.’ dux=head of a school: Quint. 5. 13. 59 duos diver-
sarum sectarum quasi duces. The terms domus and familia were often
used of a philosophie school (6.9. de Orat. 1. 10. 423 3. 16. 21): hence
the transition to lar, properly the household god, is natural. 14.
addictus: as strongly supported by MSS. as adductus, and unquestionably
right here; for the metaphor of the gladiatorial school is still retained: cf.

‘adJudged ⁹ by the praetor as the slave of his creditor, but is here employed
in a reflexive or middle sense ‘not binding myself to swear obedience to
any master? The inf. is like that in 1. 2. 27. ⁹ maqister Samnitium is
