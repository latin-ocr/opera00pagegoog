386 HORACE Boon 1

fault, furnishes Horace with his text, nil ⁴ medium est. Men are either too
generous or too stingy, too dainty or too rude ; some given to the coarser and
lower forms of vice, others to high and dangerous intrigueS. The latter
subject occupies the greater part of the Satire, from 25 ad fin., but Horace’s
treatment of it makes it scarcely profitable reading.

1. ambubaiae, female flute-players, from Syriae abuba, a flute. After
the conquest of Antiochus, 190 13.0., numbers of Syrian girls came to Rome,
and made a living by music and dancing3 cf. Suet. Ner. 27 3 Juv. 3. 62.
collegia, ‘corporations,’ as if they really formed one of those guilds or
companies recognised by law at Rome, as in England the ‘ company of merchant
taylors,’ ‘fishmongers‚’ ‘goldsmithS‚' etc. Cf. the Digest 1. ad init., colleyia
Romae certa sunt quorum corpus¹ senatus consultis atque constitutionibus prin-

cipalibus confirmatum est veluti pistorum, etc. pharmacopolae, ‘quacks,’
who hawked their drugs about the marketS. Cicero, pro Cluent. 14. 40,
mentions L. Clodius, a pharmacopola circumforaneus. 2. mendici,

‘beggars,' especially the. begging priests of Isis, Cybele, and other Eastern
deities. The begging priests of Cybele were called μητράὙυρται (collectors
for the Great Mother). Juvenal makes a J ewish priest beg, 6. 543 arcanam
Iudaea tremens mendicat in aurem Ι interpres Zeyum Solymarum. mimae,
‘ actresseS.' balatrones, perhaps from blateroneS, ⁶ praters, idle talkers,'
then here probably ‘clowns,’ ‘pantaloons.·' Cf. Lucr. 3. 955 auser abhinc
lacrimas, balatro, where Munro translates ‘ rascaL’ Festus gives blateae, lumps
of clay which adhere to the boots, as the derivation: these men hung on to
the rich as mud sticks to the feet. 3. Tigellius was a singer born in
Sardinia3 a friend of Julius Caesar (Cic. ad Fam. 7. 24). He is not to be
confounded with his relative Hermogenes Tigellius, also a singer, but spoken
of by Horace as still alive, 1. 3. 129 3 10. 90. The latter is admitted by Horace
to be a great musician, 1. 3. 129 ; 9. 25 ; but is assailed with much bitterness
by him, 1. 4. 723 1. 10. 18, 80, 90. The attacks on Tigellius the Sardinian
in this and the next Satire are of a different nature ; they point out his follies,
but without acrimony. This Tigellius was annoyed with Cicero for neglecting
to act as his and his grandfather Phamea's advocate, after promising to do so
(Cic. ad Att. 13. 49). Cicero (ad Fam. 7. 24) calls him pestilentiorem patria
sua, Sardinia being then notoriously unhealthy. In the same letter he says
of him and Phamea‚ habes Sardos venales: alium alio nequiorem, referring to
the well-known proverb, Sardi venales .· alius alio nequior.

4. quippe benignus erat, ‘ verily, he was bountiful.' He was really
prodicus, but the grateful mimae and mendici called him beniynus. hic,
‘ another.' 6. quo, neut., ‘the wherewithal to banish . . .’ 8.
ingrata: never satisfied with what has been given it, always asking for
more. Cf. Lucr. 3. 1003 deinde animi inqratam naturam pascere semper)
(itque explere bonis rebus satiareque numquam; Call. Frag. 106 ὄσσα τ’ ὀδόντων

Ιένδόθι νειαίρην τ’ εἰς ἀχάριστον ἔδυ. stringat, ‘why he strips the
splendid estate of his ancestors by his thankless gluttony.’ The meta-
phorical use of strinyere here comes from its use in stringyere frondes, ⁶ pluck
leaves from the trunk,' stringere arborem, ‘strip a tree of its leaveS,' eto.
9. conductis, ‘borrowed ' 3 cf. Juv. 11. 46 conducta pecunia. obsonia,
‘ dainties,' including meat, fish, game. The excessive love of good living was
an essentially Roman vice, often attacked by Lucilius 10. animi parvi.
The dread of being thought ‘ mean ’ was then as now the cause of the ruin of
many young men. Persius uses maynanimus of the ‘ fast ’ youth who ‘ eats '
