Achilles, Neoptolemus is the list. 4. sacro Ilio: Homer’s Ἴλιος ἱρή.

5. Chium. Of the Gk. wines import'ed by the Romans the Chian and
Lesbian were most celebrated ; cf. Epod. 9. 34 ; S. 2. 8. 15. 6. mercemur,
‘we are to buy ἐ the direct question may have been either mercamur? or
mercemur? Either would be correct, but the latter more usual. The verb is
plural because the feast is to be a δεῖπνον ἀπὸ συμβολῶν (see Lidd. and Scott
s. v. συμβολή) where each contributes his portion, ‘pays his shot ' ; one would
pay for the wine, one would provide bathe, another lend his house, and so on.
quis aquam . . . ‘who warms the bath ' τ a hot bath was frequently taken
before dinner. Others ‘who prepares the hot water (calda) for the wine!
7. quota, sc. hora, ‘ at what hour ' ε the usual hour for dinner was the ninth.

mountainous country. taces (parallel to and contrasted with narras, line 3)
is the main sentence to which the indirect questions which precede are sub-
ordinate. The single word in contrast to the seven preceding lines is very
effective: its position heightens the effect. ‘About all these things—not a word.’

9. lunae . . . puer, ‘fill up, slave, to the new moon.' tunae is the
possessive gen. and vinum is understood, ‘pour out wine of the new moon'
meaning ‘pour out wine to be drunk in honour of the new moon.' Cf. 3. 8.
13 sume . . . cyathos amici sospitis, ‘take cups (in honour) of your friend's
safety ' ; Theon. 14. 18 ἐπιχεῖσθαι ἄκρατον Ι ὢτινος ἤθελ’ ἕκαστος, ‘to pour in
wine (in honour) of whomsoever each wished.' 10. aug-uris: for the colleyium
or ‘ guild ' of augurs see Dict. of Ant. 11. tribus aut novem . . . ‘ with
three or nine ladles are the cups mingled appropriately '—appropriately that
is to the number of the Graces or the Muses, as is explained in the next lineS,
the position of commodis carefully marking this. It was the duty of the
‘master of the feast ' (mayister or arbiter bibendi, ef. 2. 7. 26) to settle
everything about the drinking, the company being bound to obey the rules he
laid down. For the benefit of this personage Horace here recites what is
evidently a well-known adage. Now as 12 cyathi make a seoetarius it has
been assumed that the adage recommends mixing 3 cyathi of wine with 9 of
water, or 9 of wine with 3 of water: at any rate such is the Judgment of
editors whose learning is superior to their taste, for how wine which was
palatable with the addition of three times its own bulk of water could be
drinkable when mixed with a third of its own bulk of water, is hard to
conceive. But in the Gk. proverb which is always quoted with regard to
drinking (Plaut. Stich. 5. 4. 24 vide quot cyathos bibimus? . . . cantio est
Graeca: ἢ πέντε πῖνε ἢ τρί’ ἢ μὴ τέτταρα) there is no mention of any propor-
tion, but only of the number of ladles to be drunk apparently with each
bumper (2 poculum), and certainly were it not for the word miscentur the
same explanation would be given here, viz. ‘ three or nine cyathi make a good
bumper,' to drink that is to each of the toasts J'ust mentioned, the cyathi being
of course taken from the mixing-bowl (crater) which would be standing by
with the wine ready mixed in it. Moreover such a rendering gives a good
meaning to cyathi, for these small ladles (containing say a wine-glass) would
be useful in filling a single goblet, useless in compounding the large common
crater. The sense too suits admirably with the next lines, the ‘ big bumper'
being for the vates attonitae, the small one for those who worshipped the
Graces, whereas according to the common rendering the poor bard is condemned
