acuminibus, camina, the connexion of thought being thus made very close.
6. saeculum . . . ‘ the grievous days when Pyrrha bewailed strange pro-
digies.' Monstrum=mmwstrum, quod monet : that which warns, a portent,
prodigy. ’7. Proteus (cf. Hom. Od. 4. 386, Virg. G. 4. 395) was
guardian of Neptune’s herds of seals. egit visere. This use of the
infinitive to express a purpose is of extreme rarity t Kennedy calls it ‘ a poetic
Graecism occasionally used after verbs implying motion, purpose.’ Cf. Virg.
Aen. 1. 527 populare Penates venimus ,· Plaut. Cas 3. 5. 48 390 huc missa
sum ludere. 11. superiecto, sc. terris .· ‘the all-covering flood.'

13. vidimus. The verb, by its abrupt and prominent position, at once
brings the mind from the days of the flood to what had actually happened in
the sight of living men. Most explain, ⁴ we have seen the yellow Tiber‚ its
waves hurled violently back from the shore of the Tuscan sea, advance to de-
stroy . . .,’ and refer to an old theory (mentioned Herod. 2. 20, but rejected,
and Seneca N. Q. 3. 26) that floods are due to the wind blowing violently against
the mouth of a river and preventing the efflux of its waters. Doubtless contrary
winds may hold up the water at a river's mouth so as to make a fiood more
severe, and we could render T. litore not ‘ from ’ (which is absurd), but ‘ at ’ or
‘ on the Tuscan shore ⁹ ; but the graphio vidimus points to something actually
visible by the Romans in Rome, and which it needs no theories to account
for. Take a map of Rome and observe how the 'I'iber flows in a straight line
past the Campus Martius until its course is checked by the island of the
Tiber and an ugly bend3 notice that on the Etrurian side (Tuscum litus) is
the lofty Janiculan, and on the other (sinistra φέροι) the low-lying Forum
Boarium, and then consider the rendering, ‘ We' have seen (as any citizen of
Rome could have seen) the yellow Tiber (yellower than ever with the flood),
its waves hurled back with violence from the (steep) banks on the Etrurian
side (against which the whole force of the stream would come), advance (as
it naturally would, checked by the river-bend and the island) to destroy,
etc. . . .' Any citizen of London might see the same effect produced by the
Thames being driven back from the lofty embankment of the Middlesex
shore to flood the humbler dwellings of the Surrey side.

15. monimenta reg-is templaque Vestae. Numa Pompilius built a
circular temple of Vesta and a palace (Βορέα) attached to it at the foot of the
Palatine. Being situated close to the low region called Velia (velum, a sail),
they would stand right in the way of the inundation. 17. Iliae. Ilia, or
Rhea Silvia, is spoken of as wife of the river into which she was thrown, and
represented as by the ⁴ importunity of her complaints ' (nimium querens) urging
her husband, the 'siber-god, to avenge the murder of her great descendant, that
Julius whose name recalled her own. 19. Iove non probante. Jupiter
had desired to warn Rome by the portents described 1-12, not to desto-oy it.
uxorius: too devoted to his wife, too willing to obey her wishes. For the
position of the word see N otes on Metres, p. xix. ἓ 1.

21. cives, Very emphatic, and so suggesting the full idea ‘ citizens
against citizens,’ which is also implied by the antithesis quo qraves Persae
