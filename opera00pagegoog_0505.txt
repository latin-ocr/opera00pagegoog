SATIRE VII

The ivise man alone is Free.

This Satire is a companion to 2. 3, in which the Stoic theory that all fools
were mad is defended by Damasippus. Here Horace’s slave Davus plays the
philosopher at second hand like Damasippus, his oracle being the hall-porter
of the pedant Crispinus, and argues that none but the wise are free. Before
the main text is reached, 45 seq„ DaWS, tired of always being listener to his
master’s tirades, takes on him to lecture his master. 'Phe vice of inconsistency
(one by the way which Horace often attacks in others) he shows attaches to
Horace himself, 20-35. The exposui-e of Horace's vices is carried on with the
most unsparing candour. How can Horace be called free, the slave of pas-
sion, 45-943 of picture-mania, 95-101 3 of gluttony, 101-111 ; of a restless
disposition, 111-115 2

Orelli says of this Satire miras rursus Stoicorum exaqqerationes inridet, a
remark which is equally inapplicable to this and to the Third Satire. There
is no ridicule. We feel as we read that Horace felt his slave’s censure was
J'ust, and that he was a slave, and knew it. Th0ugh no Stoic, Horace could
not but recognise the truth of some of these so-called paradoxes. The only
Stoic paradoxes he really ridiculos are the only ones which deserve ridicule,
viz. the equality of offences, and the doctrine of the externa] perfection of the
Sapiens (1. 3). No Satire made a stronger impression on Persius than this:
his Fifth Satire is founded on it. For much of his treatment Horace is in-
debted to Cicero's Essay on the Stoic Paradox: ὅτι μόνος ὁ σοφὸς ἐλεύθερος, καὶ
πᾶς ἄφρων δοῦλος (Parad. 5).

1. iamdudum ausculto, ‘I’ve been long listening': to what? possibly
while Horace was reading out or talking to himself (Orelli), or while he was
scolding some slaves (old comm.) Perhaps, however, ausculto only describes
the expectant attitude of a slave ready to receive orders or obey a summons—
‘I've been long waiting! 2. reformido: his master's hot temper was
well known to him. ita=etiam‚ ‘yes.’ amicum: emphatic, to >show
