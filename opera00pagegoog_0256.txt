228 ’ HORACE α Boon 1

5. lucernis: dat„ cf. Ep. 2. 2. 194 nepoti discrepet. acinaces: a
Persian word for a short, straight sword, or dirk. 'Phe Persians seem to have
worn these even at banquets : at Rome it was illegal to wear a weapon at all
within the city. 6. inmane quantum discrepat, ‘is utterly at variance
with! inmane quantum (cf. θαυμαστὸν ὅσον, ἀμήχανον ὅσον) is strictly a
sentence = ‘it is enormous how much‚’ but is used as a simple adverb,
‘ enormously.’ It is used by Tacitus, mirum quantum by Livy, ‘nimium
quantum by Cicero. inpium: as violating the respect due to the god
Bacchus. 8. cubito presso. At meals the Romans reclined upon
couches, resting on the left elbow‚ which sank deep (presso) into the cushions.

9. vultis. A question addressed to the company, who are clamouring
that 110 should drink his share (partem). severi, ‘ strong to the taste,’
‘potent‚' cf. 2. 3. 8 n.; S. 2. 4. 24. 10. Opuntia Megylla: a fictitious
name; Opus was the capital of the Opuntian LocrianS. Horace insists that
he will only drink if a toast is given: it was customary to drink a lady’s
liealth in bumpers containing as many cyathi as there were letters in the name.
Cf. Mart. 1. 71 Laevia sex cyathi3‚ septem Iustina bibatur, Ι quinque Lycas,
Lyde quattuor, Ida tribus. 11. quo beatus . . . ‘what is the wound‚
what the shaft of which 110 15 the happy victim ’.ἰ ’ ‚beatus goes with both
pereat and vulnere: notice the oxymoron in beatus vulnere, and the double
meaning of perire, ‘to perish' and ‘to be dying of love for.’ For vulnus
applied to love, cf. Lucr. 1. 35 aeterno devictus vulnere amoris.

13. cessat voluntas ἰ’ ‘ are you unwilling and reluctant? ’ Horace
suddenly turns to the frater Meqyllae. Some MSS. have voluptas 14.
quae te cumque . . . ‘whatever Queen of Beauty enslaves yon, she . . .'
The whole is sarcastic: it is hinted that he is in love with a slave, cf. 2. 4. 1 ;
ingenuo therefore is emphatic, ‘it is no low-born love that leads you wrong.'
15. erubescendis: erubeseo ‘ blush ’ can take an acc. in the secondary sense
of ‘blush for' (cf. 2. 13. 26 n.)‚ and so can have a gerundive= ‘that is to be
blushed for‚’ ‘ashamed of.’ 18. a miser . . . He is supposed to have
whispered. the name, and Horace hearing it exclaims a miser . . . in a tone
of affected pity. 19. laborabas, ‘ in what a terrible Charybdis were
you struggling,’ the words also meaning ‘ with what a devouring creature were
you hopelessly in love.' For laboro cf. 1. 17. 19 and for Charybdis Anaxilas
(in Athen.) ὴ δὲ Φρύνη τὴν Χάρυβδιν οὐχὶ πόρρω που ποιεῖ, Ι τὸν δὲ ναύκληρον
λαβοῦσα καταπέπωκ’ αὐτῷ σκάφει. The imperfect laborabas seems like
the Gk. imperfect with ἄρα used when a person finds out that what he sus-
pected all along 15 really so: ‘ Ι always thought some monster had got hold
of you, and now I find it true ’ ; cf. Herod. 3. 64 ἔλεγεν ἄρα (of what an oracle
meant all along), Soph. Phil. 978 ; Hom. Ι1. 16. 33. .

21. Thessalis. Thessalian wizards were celebrated; Epod. 5. 45.
23. vix inligatum . . . ‘hardly will Pegasus disentangle you from the
toils of this Chimaera.’ The Chimaera (χίμαιρα ‘ a goat ’) 15 described Hom.
11. 6. 181 πρόσθε λέων, ὄπιθεν δὲ δράκων, μέσση δὲ χίμαιρα. Here it is put
for any man-destroying monster, from which even aid such as that of Belle·
rophon on Pegasus cannot afford deliverance.
