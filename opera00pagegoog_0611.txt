commonly reyarclecl as muner-skip yives no more pleasure to the temporam] pro-
prielor than is derived from the use of tlte produce by any one who can buy it .-
anel no one can really own anytkiny in perpetuity. 156. nempe, ‘ of
course,’ often ironically, but not so here or below line 163: cf. nimirum above:
so S. 1. 10. 1 ; 2. 3. 207 ; 7. 80. 107. 158. libra et aere: Gaius 1. 119
thus describes the process: est autem mancipatio . . . imaginaria quaedam
venditio .· quod et ipsum ius proprium civium Rmnanorum est ,· eaque ‘res ita
aqitur. adhibitis non minus quam quinque testibus civibus Romanis puberibus,
et praeterea alio eiusdem condicionis qui libram aeneam teneat, qui appellatur
libripens, is qui mancipio accipiat rem, aes tenens ita dicit : hunc ego hominem
ex iure Quiritium meum esse aio, isque mihi emptus est hoc aere aeneaque
libra: deinde aere percutit libram, idque aes dat ei a quo mancipio accipit,
quasi pretii loco. The articles sold by mancipation were slaves, oxen, horses,
mules and asses, and lauded property in Italy. The coin or ingot was of
bronze, because in the early days that metal was alone used for coinage : the
balance was employed because all money was originally weighcd out by the
purchaser. 159. consultis as in line 87. mancipat, ‘ makes your
property.² Strictly speaking mancipare could be used only of the transference
of chattels by the formal mancipatio just described. But uninterrupted en-
J'oyment (usus, usucapio) of moveable property for one year, of immoveable
for two years, gave a legal title in the case of res mancipi and res nec mancipi
alike 3 and this is here loosely described by the term mancipare. The line of
thought is ⁶ If not merely purchase, but also continuous enjoyment makes
property your own, then there is no advantage in the ownership of 3 large
estate ε you enjoy it just as much if you can purchase enough of its produce
to supply your needs ' ; cf. Cic. ad Fam. 7. 30 id cuiusque est proprium, quo
quisque fruitur atque utitur. 161. daturas: so the codol. Bland. and
other good MSS„ and the reading is preferable to the alternative daturus, as
the word seems to go better with the ‘ corn-fields ⁹ (segetes) than with the
bailiff : cf. Virg. G. 2. 440, 520.

163. temeti: an old word used by Plautus, and by Cato according to Pliny,
H. N. 14. 13. 90 Cato ideo propinquos feminis osculum clave (scripsit), ut scirent
an temetum olerent. hoc tum vino nomen erat, uncle et temulentia appellata.
abstemius is akin: cf. Gen. 10. 23. 1 aetatem abstemias misse, hoc est vino
semper, quod temetum prisca linqua appellabatur, abstinuisse. 164.
mercaris: the purchaser of the estate has to pay the price down, while a
man who buys the produce secures all the advantage of it, and has only to
pay by instalments. But Horace seems to forget that after the full value of the
land had been paid in these instalments, the purchaser of the produce would
still have to go on paying for all that he wanted. 166. numerato, not
here in the technical sense of ‘ready money ’ (cf. 2. 1. 105 n.)‚ but ‘by what
you have paid down.’ You must pay in any case, says Horace3 the only
question is whether you have Just paid‚ or paid long ago. For the construc-
tion cf. vivere ‘rapto Virg. Aen. 7. 749, and often in Livy. olim=quon-
dam of the next line.

16⁰7. emptor quondam go together, ‘ a man who bought of old,' cf. Od.
3. 17. 9 n. The great preponderance of MS. authority is in favour of quoniam,
which Keller warmly defends, placing a comma at olim, and the note of interro-
gation at aenum. But quondam and quoniam would be represented 111 the
MSS. by almost indistinguishable abbreviatione, and the· former clearly makes
the better construction. Aricini Veientis et arvi. suburbana praedia
