233. Choerilus. There were three poets of this name. (1) Choerilus
of Athens, who exhibited tragedies, 523-483 B.C.: (2) Ch. of Samos, the
composer of an epic poem on the Persian wars, a younger contemporary
and friend of Herodotus: (3) Ch. of Iasos, also an epic poet, but of a very 111-
ferior kind, who followed Alexander to Asia. This last is the one here meant :
in A. P. 357 he is taken as the type of a poet who sometimes ‘ deviates into'
excellence. Acron here says that he had only seven good lines in his poem on
the exploits of Alexander, for each of which he received a gold piece. On
A. P. 357 he adds that Alexander had bargained to give him this reward, 011
condition that the bard should receive a blow for every bad verse, and that he
died of the blows. 'Phe king is reported to have said malle se Thersiten Homeri
esse quam Choerili Achillem, which does not look as if he was so bad a judge
of poetry as Horace represents him to have been ; and indeed he was not only
the pupil of Aristotle, but also himself an enthusiastie student of Homer.

Darius, but from the Persian dard, ‘kings The coins of Philip had on one
