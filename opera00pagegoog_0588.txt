560 HORACE Boon 11

comic poets by Volcatius Sedigitus (a critic quoted by A. Gellius 15. 24) an-
cilio palmam statuo dandam comico, Plautus secundus facile eaesuperai ceteros,
etc„ while Terence only comes sixth in his list. He is often quoted by Cicero,
who however censures his bad style (Brut. 74. 258 ; ad Att. 7. 3. 10), and was
distinguished especially for skill in the management of his plots. His yravitas
seems to have been shown in his sententious maxims. Τὶιθ ‘art ' of Terence
appears in the careful finish of his style. Of. Caesar’s lines quoted by Sueton.
Vit. Terent., where he calls him dimidiate Menander and puri sermonis amator.

60. arto, ‘throngecl‚’ too narrow for the numbers : cf. spissis . . . theatris
in 1. 19. 41. 'rbere however the theatra are the private recitation-halls z here
they are the public theatres‚ of which there were three permanent ones in Rome
at this time, one built by Cn. Pompeius in 55 Ro. near the Circus Flaminius,
one built by Augustus in honour of Marcellus (not finished however until 11
13.c. )‚ important remains of which are still standing near the Tarpeiau Hill, and
a third built by Cornelius Balbus between the other two, It had previously
been the custom to perform plays in temporary wooden theatres, often of great
magnificence. 61. potens: so mighty, and yet so wanting in critical dis-
cernment. The strange lack of great dramatists or poets of any kind in the

’ half century preceding Lucretius and Catullus seems due partly to the ‘ separa-

tion in taste and sympathy between the higher classes and the mass of the
people ' (Sellar 265), which made literature the amusement of a narrow circle,
and partly to the disturbed political conditions of the time. The continued
popularity of the old tragedians may be ascribed to the extent to which they
represented some of the best features in the old Roman character (ib. 151).
62. Livi ι Livius Andronicus, who in 240 B.c. first brought upon the stage a
Latin translation of a Greek tragedy.

63-75. A sound critic mast admit that these early ioriters have many defesis
os armotiam, barshneSS, and carelessness. A few happy phrases or lines must
not lead us to reyard a ‘eenole poem as perfect. 63. est ubizecm ὅτε, ‘ at
times '·: hence peccat, not peccet, which has very slight authority, is the

- right mood. Cf. 2. 2. 1823 S. 1. 4. 243 Roby 1687. 66. pleraque,

‘ much‚’ not ‘the greater part.’ 68. mecum facit, ‘supports my
view ’ ‘; cf. 2. 2. 23. Iove aequo, ‘with the favour of Heaven,' i.e.
in his sound senses. Of. S. 2. 7. 14 iniquis Vertumnis ; 2. 3. 8 dis iratis.
iniquus meaning ‘ unfavourable‚’ its opposite aequus comes to mean not merely
‘impartial ' but ‘ favourable ' ε Virg. Aen. 6. 129 pauci quos aequus amavit Ι

Iuppiter; and so often. 70. plagosum ε the word does not appear to be used
elsewhere in this active sense : it is found in Apuleius in the sense of ‘ much-
beaten.’ The primary force of -osus ‘ abounding in ’ (cf. nodosus 1. 1. 31 ; S. 2.
3. 69 ; damnosas, animosae, etc.) lends itself to either usage. 71. Orbilium:
one of the masters at Rome, to whose lessons Horace was taken by his father (S.
1. 6. 76-82). According to Suetonius he was a native of Beneventum who, aster
serving for a time in the army, taught for several years in his native town, and
came to Rome when fifty years of age in the consulship of Cicero (63 B.c.),
where he taught maiore fama qnam emolumento. He died in poverty when nearly
a hundred years of age. For his severity towards his pupils, see Intr. i.
dictare: i.e. that the pupils might learn it by heart, cf. 1. 1. 55 ; 1. 18. 13.
72. exactis, ‘perfectly finished,’ properly of works of art. Cf. Ov. Met. 1.
405 forma hominis . . . sed uti de marmore coepta non exacta satis. 74.
concinnior, ‘ better-turned ': the word is properly used of regular beauty ;
1. 11. 2. 75. ducit, ‘brings after it,' ‘ carries with it’; the good verse
