26. sonantem . . . dura, ‘chanting . . . the hardshjps.’ Many in-

aures. The effect produced on Cerberus is stupor (stupens) ; he does
not listen, for to listen he would ‘prick up his ears ' (cf. aures acutas 2. 19. 4),
but is lulled into forgetfulness of his duties as a watch-dog, ‘he lets his dark
ears droop.' centiceps. Hesiod‚ Theog. 312, speaks of Cerberus as κύνα
πεντηκοντακάρηνον, Sophocles, Trach. 1098, as τρίκρανον, and he is generally
so represented 3 cf. 2. 19. 31. 36. Eumenidum ε Εὐμενίδες, ‘the

—Wickham. Pelopis parens: Tantalus, 38. laborum decipitur,
‘ are cheated of their toils.' The gen. depends on the sense of ‘forgetfulness '
or ‘ freedom ' contained in decipitum the song makes them forgetful of their
agonies. Good MSS. give laborem, an acc. of respect, which is less elegant.
Prometheus et Pelopis parens . . . decipitur. The verb is singular
in accordance with Horace’s favourite practice of putting a singular verb
after -two nominatives, if the last one be singular. Cf. 2. 1. 28, 2. 11. 2
Cantaber et Scythes cogitet, 3. 11. 22 Intimi Tityosque risit, 2. 18. 26 pellitur
