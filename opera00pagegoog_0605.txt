24. 14. 6 puro ac patenti campo. plateae is often marked platea in diction-
aries with this passage and Catull. 15. 7 noted as exceptional instances of the
short penultimate. But it is often short in Terence, and no instance is quoted
of the long penultimate, which might have been expected from the derivation
of the word from πλατεῖα, earlier than Prudentius We have a parallel to the
shortening in balineum from βαλανεῖον, chorea, yynaeceu‘m etc. (Roby 229).

72. calidus, ‘in hot haste ’ : cf. S. 1. 3. 53 ; Od. 3. 14. 27, where however
the meaning is rather ‘ impetuouS.² redemptor, ‘ a contractor ' for build-
ings ; cf. Od. 3. 1. 35. mulis gerulisque, instrumental ablatives, indicating
how the contractor showed his impetuosity3 cf. Livy 9. 38. 7 armis virisque
aa oppnmendum Ο. Marcium concurrunt. Kriiger compares military ex-
pressions such as inqenti exercitu, omnibus copii8‚ quadrato afflniue .· but the
addition of the epithet makes all the difference. 73. machina, apparently
‘a crane’ which ‘swings’ (torquet) stones or beams needed for building,
properly called tolleuo, but sometimes by a metaphor like our own, ciconia,
cf. γέρανος. 74. robustis, i.e. built for heavy loads3 cf. S. 1. 6. 42 si
plaustra ducenta Ι concurrantque soro ἰτέα, funera. The use of wheeled
vehicles was forbidden in Rome until ten hours after sunrise‚ except in the
case of those employed in connexion with public buildingS, templeS‚ etc„ of
market-carts leaving the city, and of certain privileged persons, 76. 1 nunc :
cf. 1. 6. 17 n. : ‘now,' i. e. after suffering all these things.

77. scriptorum, of poets especially, as in 2. 1. 36 and elsewhere.
urbem: the great preponderance of MS. authority is in favour of the
singular. Many editors however prefer the· plural, on the ground that the
singular after what has gone before can only: ‘ Rome! This would certainly
be the case, if nemus, used 111 a generic sense, had not come between : but the
parallelism justifies us in following the MSS„ and taking urbem generally:
‘the town’ as opposed to ‘the country! 78. rite cliens Bacchi, ‘in
loyal allegiance to Bacchus? rite: ‘as is fit! Of. Od. 2. 193 3. 25. 79.
strepitus: Od. 3. 29. 12 fumum et opes strepitumque Romae. The continual
noise at Rome is one of its worst terrors, as painted by Juv. Sat. 3. The
rhyme in nocturnos . . . diurnos seems intentional and imitative. 80.
contracta: the great maJ‘ority of MSS. have contacta, which seems indefen-
sible‚ though Dillenburger explains contacta sequi aszcoutinqere et sequi. cou-
tracta ⁴ narrow ² describes a track which few have trodden, not broad and beaten.

composition. statua taciturnius: cf. S. 2. 5. 40 infantes statuas ; Lucian,

introduced in Latin by the ‘and,’ which would be natural in English.
