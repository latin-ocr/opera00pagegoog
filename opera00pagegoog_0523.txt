our ‘ respect ' as implying rather regard sor the wishes or interests of some
one.

when his cliyestz'on troubles him. Horace here, as elsewhere, gives a humorous
turn at the close to the argument which he has been seriously propounding.

EPISTLE H

This Epistle is addressed to Lollius MaximuS, probably the elder son of M.
Lollius, to whom Od. 4. 9 was afterwards addressed. The date is not certain.
Epistle 18 of this book is, probably, also addressed to the same Lollius, and
we learn from that (line 55) that he had served under Augustus in the Canta-
brian war 25-24 13.c. Perhaps after serving (as puer) in that war he returned
to Rome, and took up again the practice of declamation, just as Cicero did
after his service in the Social War. In that case 23 13.c. would be a plausible
date ; but the use of puer in line 68 is not inconsistent with a date a year or two
later. The practice of rhetoric under teaehers was often carried 011 long after
the years of manhood had been reached. Cicero studied under Molo when 28.
