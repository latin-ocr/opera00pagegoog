cf. 1. 2. 31 ; Ο(1. 4. 3. 18 dulcem strepitum. terrae gravis, ‘with lumber-
ing tread‚' lit. ‘a heavy burden to the earth! et tamen, i.e. and yet,
though you can get no diversions as you complain, you have to work hard.
27. iampridem : either a reproach to the vilicus who ought to have seen to
these fields long before, or implying that the land had been long neglected
when it came into the hands of Horace. 23. strictis frondibus: Virg.
Ecl. 9. 60 hic ubi densas ayrieolae etrinyunt frondes. This was done when
the herbage wasparched, in the summer and autumn ε cf. Columella 6. 3 tota
aestate et deinde autumno (boves) satientur fronde. 29. pigro, i.e. if you
have nothing else to do. rivus, the Digentia (1. 18. 104). 30. do-
cendus: cf. A. P. 67 amnis Ι doctus iter metius.

:sl-39. I once liked a ρας] town-life .· now I care only for the quiet of the
country. 31. nostrum concentum dividat, ‘ breaks up our harmony!
32. tenues . . . togae, opposed to crassae (S. 1. 3. 15), were worn by men
who cared about their dress. They were of a ‘ finer ’ stuff than the ordinary
toga. nitidi, i. e. with perfumed oils, not only at banquets, but in some
cases all day long: cf. Cic. in Cat. 2. 10. 22 pexo capillo nitidos; pro Sest. 8.
18 unquentis affluens, calamistrata coma ,· Ov. A. A. 3. 443 nee coma vosfatlat
liquido nitidissima narde, Ι . . . nec toqa decipiat filo tenuissima. 33.
inmunem, ‘though I brought nogift': cf. od. 3. 23. 17; 4. 12122.
Cinarae: 1. 7. 28 11. 34. liquidi, ‘clear,’ i.e. strained through a
colum, or otherwise refined: cf. S. 2. 4. 51-58; Mart. 12. 60 ut liqnidmn
potet Alauda merum, Ι turbida sollicito transmittere Caecuba saoce. This
process was necessary for the stronger wines. 36. incidere, ‘ to cut short ’';
Virg. Ecl. 9. 14 novas incidere lites. There is a kind of zeugma, puderet
being understood with incidere. ‘ No shame Ι dcem it to have had my sport :

Ι The shame had been in frolics not cut short ’—Con.

38. limat, from lima, ‘a fi1e‚’ hence ‘to diminish ’ or ‘disparageff But
Horace also intends a play upon the phrase timis oculis (S. 2. 5. 53) -- ‘ askance.’
morsuque ε cf. od. 4. 3. 16 iam dente minus mordeor invido. . 39. rident ε
doubtless good-humouredly, but Horace's figure and habits must have unfitted
him for active service. Madvig (Advers. Crit. 2. 61) would punctuate
moventem cum servis. mbana . . . The emphasis, he says, lies upon
urbana, which must therefore be brought into prominence‚ and cum servis is
out of place in the second sentence, for the vilicus would be in the company of
slaves quite as much in the country as in the town. But a vilicus would not
be allowanced in the country, and, besideS, horum becomes unintelligible.
The juxtaposition of servis and urbana, though not quite a hypallage, naturally
suggests to the mind the notion of town-slaves, which horum takes up.

40-44. Y ou wmdd fain chanqe your place, thouqlt others envy you. Euerg(
one should be eontented with what he is nwst fit for. 40. rodere, ‘ munch‚'
suggests poor and limited fare. 41. horum voto ruis, ‘you would fain
hasten to join their number.’ invidet usum . . . N onius 164 quotes
from Pomponius the Atellan poet, Zonqe ab urbe vttieari, quo 'erus rarenter
venit, Ι non viticari sed dominari est mea sententia. 42. calo: properly
a soldier’s servant, then a groom (S. 1. 6. 103), or any low servant, or
drudge (S. 1. 2. 443 Senec. Ep. 110. 17 lectica somnosis inposita calonibus):
