6. levis, ‘beardless,' ‘smooth-faced '; cf. 4. 6. 28 levis A yyieu‚ ‘O ever-
youthful Apollo.’ arida canitie, ‘ wizened hoary age.' 9. non
semper . . . Cf. Hymns A. and M.: ‘Yet birds and flowerets round us
preach3 Ι All, all the present evil teach Ι Sufficient for the day.’ 11.
aeternis . . . fatigas: consiliis is governed both by minorem and fatiyas.
‘ Why weary with etex-nal schemes your mind which is less than (i.e. incapable
of dealing with) them'ss' aeternis bears two senses: (l)=‘ceaseless,' (2)=
‘that are concerned with an infinite future,’ as if you would live for ever.

13. platano. The plane was a favourite tree in pleasure-gardens because
of the shelter afforded by its broad-spreading leaves (πλάτανος, πλατύς), cf.
Plat. Phaedr. 229 A, 330 Β. hac: graphio and vivid. 14. sio temere,
‘carelessly just as we are’ 3 cf. Hom. Il. 2. 120 μὰψ οὕτω, Plato
Gorg. 506 D οὕτως εἰκῆ. The final e of temere is of doubtful quantity and
always elided 111 poetry. et rosa . . . ‘and our gray locks crowned with
scented roseS.² 16. Assyria: cf. n. on malobathro SyriO, 2. 7. 8. 17.
Euhius. Bacchus was so called from the cry εὐοῖ (2. 19. 5) used in his

festivals, 18. edaces, ‘carking,' ‘consuming’ 3 cf. 1. 18. 4 mordaces
sollicitudines. puer: παῖς, ‘ a slave.’ ocius, ‘ with more than ordinary

speed.' 19. Falerni: cf. 2. 3. 8 11. Its ‘fire' needed to be ‘quenched'

21. quis devium . . . ‘who will lure Lyde, that coy damsel‚ from her
home‘3' 22. dio age . . . maturet, ‘ go, bid her hasten.’ aye is used
like an interjection and does not affect the construction ; maturet is dependent
on dic, being the subj. , of Oblique Petition. 23. 111 comptum . . .
nodum, ‘her hair bound back into a neat knot after the fashion of a
Laconian maiden.’ Any one who has seen a Greek statue will know the
simple elegance with which Greek women dressed their hair, and the Laconians
were especially noted for simplicity. Many MSS. read incomptum, which
gives no satisfactory construction. Bentley seeing the excellent sense given
by the adj. incomptus in connexion with Horace’s hasty summons, boldly
proposes to read incomptam . . . comam reliyata nodo.

ODE XII

‘ Y ou would not, Ι am suffe, Maecenas, desire that I should attempt to tell
of the war-s of the Romans and the contests of yods and heroes on the peaceful
lyre, and besides you yourself will recount Gaesao-'s triumphs better in a prose
history. 'Tis my more fittiny taslc to describe the charms of Licymnia—
Licymnia one sinyle curl of whom you would not barter for the wealth os
Arabia, so powerful are her kisses, her coquam, and her love!

Doubtless Horace had been urged by Maecenas to compose an Ode or Odes
on some national theme in which the deeds of Augustus might be introduced
as a climax (for an instance see 2. 1. 6), and this Ode is his apology for refus-
ing to do so—a refusal for which he atones by selecting Licymnia (i.e. Terentia,
his wife) as a perfect instance of a theme more befitting his Muse.

1. nolis . . . tuque . . . dices, ‘you would be unwilling (i.e. on general
grounds of taste and inappropriateness) . . . and (there is also a special
reason, viz.) you will yoursels tell . . .’ longa ferae: both adJ‘ectives
are emphatic ; ‘long' wars need an epic poem, ‘savage ' combats do not suit
the lyre. Numantia was taken EO. 133 by P. Scipio Africanus the younger
after a siege of eight years. 2. dirum Hannibalem. Τ116 MSS. read
