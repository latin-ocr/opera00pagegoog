SATIRE X
Horacc's Oriticisms of, aud his Relatiou to, Lucilius. ΒΑΤΕ, ῗῑ 35 13.c.

The criticisms Horace had made on Lucilius and his style (4. 6-13) had
given offence to some of the admirers of the old hard. Horace defends his
remarks, does not retract them, in this Satire. He allows that Lucilius was
caustic, 4, and farcical, 8 3 but that is not enough. Terseness is essential‚ 9 :
the mixture of fun and gravity, of poetry, rhetoric, and wit, which the poets
of the old comedy possessed, ought to belong to the satirist, 11—18. Lucilius'

-use of Greek words was a positive blemish‚ 20-30. Satire was the only branch
of poeti-y left open for Horace, and he has had fair success in it, though he
avows himself inferior to Lucilius 3 but still he claims the right to point out
the obvious defects in Lucilius, which he himselfwould be the first to acknowledge
if he were alive, 56-71. Care and revision are necessary for the production of
poetry which shall win the approbation of the select few: the fit audience
that he himself has found in Virgil, Varius, MaecenaS, and others, whose
approval is more to be valued than that of the multitude.

The eight verses in brackets are to be condemned as spurious on both
external and internal evidence. They are not found in the best MSS. ; the
scholiasts are silent about them3 the fourth verse has a false quantity vir,
which it is not easy to emend 3 ut redeam illuc in 8 has no meaning.
