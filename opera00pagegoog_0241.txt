proximus, on the other hand, merely means ‘ next,’ and is compatible with
the existence of the widest possible gap. So Virg. Aen. 5. 320, in describing
a race‚ says of ‘ a bad second,' proximus huic, lonqo sed proximus intervallo.
In Macaulay’s famous instance of ⁴ Eclipse first and the rest nowhere‚' the
second horse would be proximus but not secundus.

21. proeliis audax. Some put a full stop after this and make it go
with Pallas, but the run of the verse seems against this. For Bacchus, as a
courageous divinity‚ see 2. 19. 28. 22. virgo. The huntress Diana.
26. hunc equis . . . Of. S. 2. 1. 26; Hom. Il. 3. 237 Κάστορά θ’
ἱππόδαμον καὶ πὺξ ἀγαθὸν Πολυδεύκεα. 27. quorum . . . Cf. 1. 3. 2 n.
29. defluit . . . The wind had driven the spray and surge high on to the
rocks: now it drips from them again. 31. et minax . . . ‘and the
threatening wave, because such is their pleasure, sinks back on the bosom
of the deep.'

33. quietum, ‘peacefuL’ Numa Pompilius was the legendary author of
most civil and religious, as Romulus was of most warlike observances. 34.
superbos Tarquini fasces, ‘the proud sway of Tarquin‚' :the sway of
Tarquin the Proud ε a good instance of hypallage 3 cf. 3. 1. 42 n. Horace does
not mention Tarquinius Superbus as a hero, but because he is thinking of the
glorious deeds connected with his expulsion. Then the thought of the great
author of Roman freedom, Brutus, suggests the name of him who refused to
survive that freedom, Cato, 35. Catonis nobile letum. The suicide of
Cato at Utica, after the battle of Thapsus (13.0. 46), is continually referred to
with indiscriminate praise by the poets and philosophers of the next century.
For the frequency of suicide under the empne, see Merivale, Hist. c. 74.

37. Scauros. The reference is chiefly to M. Aemilius Scaurus, consul
B.c. 115 and 107, censor B.c. 109. His character was none of the best
(Mommsen, bk. 4. c. 4) and he accepted bribes from Jugurtha in B.c. 111,
but the name is merely used as a typica] one for ‘ a fine old Roman.’ 38.
Paulum. Consul with C. Terentius Varro 3 at the fatal battle of Cannae
(B.c. 216) he refused to fly. 39. insigni Camena, ‘the muse that gives
renown.' N otice that in praise of these national heroes, he receives the aid of
the national Camenae, not of the foreign Μοῦσαι. 41. incomptis capillis.
Barbers were introduced at Rome B.0. 300. The elder Cato is called intonsus
2. 15. 11. These bearded ancients are a type of manly vigour. 43. saeva
paupertas et . . . ‘ stern poverty and a farm handed down from father
to son, with a modest homestead! The words avitus apto cum Lare fundus
give a fair definition of what the Romans would call paupertas. It is here
the condition of a small yeoman ; cf. 3. 16. 37 n. ; Ep. 2. 2. 12 n.

45. crescit . . . A faultless line. The comparison expresses the sure,
silent, and steady growth of the fame of the name Marcellus. occulto
aevo, ‘by the silent lapse of time.' aemam (=acfwv, root i, ‘to go ') is
‘that which passes away! 46. Marcelli. This family traced its origin
to Marcellus who won the spolia opima for the third and last time Re. 222,
and conquered Syracuse B.c. 212. For the young Marcellus see Dict. He
married Julia, the daughter of AugustuS‚ B.c. 25 ; cf. Virg. Aen. 6. 860-886.
47. Iulium sidus, ‘the star of the Julian line.' The word ‘star' is used
generally: ⁶ fortune ' in reference to the astrological idea of a ruling star, and
specially with reference to the comet (Iulium sidus) which appeared about
the period of Caesar's death, and indicated his reception into heaven.
