380 HORACE BOOK 1

23. praeterea, ‘ to pass to another point.' The point does not come until
line 28, being interrupted by a double parenthesis. The construction is ‘ne sic
(haec) rideris percurram ut qui iocularia (ridens percurrit). iocularia has its
opposite in seria line 27. Τ116 picture of Jupiter with his cheeks inflated has
probably suggested to Horace that he is treating his subject lightly. 25.
olim, ‘at times,’ ‘often,’ ‘usually'3 cf. Ep. 1. 10. 42 ut calceus uim,- Ov.
Fast. 3. 555 ut olim Ι amisso dubiae reye vayautur apes ,· Plaut. Truc. 1. 1.
45 nuuc lenonum plus est fere, Ι quam olim muscarum est, cum caletur maxime.
crustula, ‘little cakes' ; crustum is anything with a crust. blandi, ‘ coaxing.’
The simile is from Lucr. 1. 936 sed veluti pueris absinthia taetra medentes Ι
cum dare conantur, prius oras pocula circum Ι coutinyuut mellis dulci flavoque
liquore. 26. elementa prima, ‘their first rudiments,' especially the
alphabet. elementa by itself is the alphabet only3 cf. Ep. 1. 1. 27; Suet.

28. The point which had been interrupted by the parenthesis is now taken
up. The different seekers aster wealth compare themselves to the ant laying
by its winter store. Horace denies the fairness of the comparison. ille, ‘ yon. ’
This word and hic line 29 are literally demonstrative. 29. perfidus hic
caupo : the caupones, κάπηλοι, shop—keepers, especially tavern-keepers, seem
to have been proverbially sharp in their dealings ; 1. 5. 4 cauponibus maliyuis.
The caupo does not appear among the discontented persons introduced at the
beginning of the Satire, but takes the place of the consultus. This is rendered
necessary by Horace's change of front, for the jurisconsult could not be made
a type of the avarus, as 116 did not charge money for his advice. Even
advocates (causidici) were forbidden by the Cincian law (204 Β.6.) 10 accept
1665, though the law was often evaded. 30. currunt, ‘sail ' ; cf. Ep. 1.
1. 45 extremos curris ad Indos ,· Ep. 1. 11. 27 qui trans mare currunt. 32.
congesta: chosen to suit the metaphor of the ant heaping up her pile.
cibaria, which properly means ‘rations‚' is used by the avari, who, extenu-
ating their real object, the endless pursuit of riches as an end, say they in-
tend to desist as soon as they have gained sufficient to keep them from starvation.

33. nam exemplo est, apologetic 3 although tiny‚ it can enforce a moral.
magni contrasted with and excusing parvula: ‘ thaijffigmm
industry ’ (Con). For the ant as a type of provident industry, cf. Virg. G. 1.
Tgffffiuv. 6. 36ος Prov. vi. 6. In prose one would expect animal before
‘magyui laboris ‚· cf. 2. 8. 84 Nasidieue redis mutatae frontis 35. futuri both
with ignara and incauta. The ant knows by instinct and experience that
winter is coming, and provides against it. incautus with gen. is rare, and
Horace would not have used that construction had he not first used issquara.

36. quae=at ca. Horace denies the pertinence of the simile. The ant
makes merry on her store throughout the drear winter ;-the avarus never
pauses from his pursuit of wealth to give himself a moment's enj0yment of it.
inversum annum: ‘the inverted year' may mean the new year, the sun
entering Aquarius on J an. 16111. Cf. the Homeric περιτελλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν;
Theocr. 13. 26 τετραμμένω εἴαρος ἤδη. The year has run it's course and begins
as it were over again. But, perhaps, as vomerem inversum, Epod. 2. 63,=the
ploughshare turned backwards so that it will not cut3 as inversi moreS, od.
3. 5. 7,=manners with their bad side out, altered for the worse ; as virtutes
invertere, 1. 3. 55,=to turn virtues into vices3 so here inversus aurius may
mean the year with its winter side, wet and cold, turned towards one, the

bright summer side being turned out of sight. 37. iuis must be em-
