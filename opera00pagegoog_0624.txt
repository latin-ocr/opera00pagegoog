marshes by Pomentium and Setia . . . He proposed further to make great
mounds on the shore nearest Rome, to hinder the sea from breaking in upon
the land, to clear the coast at Ostia of all the hidden rocks and shoals that
made it unsafe for shipping, and to form ports and harbours fit to receive the
large number of vessels that would frequent them. These things were designed
without being carried into effect.' Now it seems pretty clear that the draining
of the Pomptine marshes was never carried out to an extent sufficient to
justify Horace’s language, if taken strictly. There is great probability there-
fore in the view of Preller (Aufsatze 515 seq.) that Horace has in view through-
out the designs of Julius rather than any works actually executed by Augustus·
It would be a very doubtful compliment to the reigning emperor to take great
engineering operations of his as instances of works doomed to pass away3
whereas it would be natural for him to speak thus of gigantic schemes com-
menced a quarter of a century before and never completely carried out. We
must therefore suppose Horace to be using a kind of poetic anticipation,

‘assuming the great dictator's plans to have been achieved, still they are
destined to >fail in the long run.’

73-309. In this second main section of the poem Horace applies his general
principles to the treatment of different kinds of poetry, passing from one to
the other with little formality, but dwelling mainly upon the drama.

73-85. Homer first wrote hexameters ,· theu followed eleqiao verse of uu-
certaiu oriyiu ; iambios were invented by Archilochus for his lampoouS, aud
adopted both by oomedy aud trayedy. Lyrie verse is fitted for Itymus, sor odes
of victory, aud for souqs about love aud wine. 74. Homerus : the inven-
tion of the hexameter was ascribed to the Delphic priests, and probably the
earliest epic poetry——which must have existed for centuries before the Iliad
assumed its present form—was of purely religious origin. Cf. Mahaffy's Greek
Lit. 1. 15-17. ’1110 hexameter arose from a combination of two short lineS‚
the first normally — 0 o Ι - υ υ Ι - , 1110 second the same but with an anacrusis‚
and an added syllable at the end— Ι -uu Ι -uu Ι -ΙΙ-. From this the
pentameter was formed by the omission of the added elements in the second
half. Thus the character of the verse was entirely changed. Of. Ooleridge's
version of Schiller’s lines: ‘In the hexameter rises the fountain's silvery
column: Ι 111 the pentameter aye falling in melody back.'

Horace seems to allude to the popular derivation of ἔλεγος from ἒ ἒ λέγειν
‘to say ah me.’ The word is probably of Phrygian origin, denoting primarily
