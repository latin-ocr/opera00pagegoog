NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ METRES USED IN THE ODES
AND EPODES

ΤΗΕ Alcaic mette is so called from the Greek poet Alcaeus of Lesbos, who
is said to have invented it. It is employed by Horace more frequently
than any other, and is es cially used when 3 lofty and dignified tone is
assumed. It occurs in the ollowing Odes, which contain in all 317 stanzas:
Ι. 9, 16, 17, 26, 27, 29, 31, 34, 35, 37; 11. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,13,14,
15, 17, 19, 203 111. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 17, 21, 23, 26, 29; IV. 4, 9, 14, 15.

υυυυυυυυυ ’ὗ

§L The first syllable in the first three lines is common but a short
syllable is very φανεὶς] used ε 13 instances occur in the First Book, 5 111 the
Second, 7 111 the Third, and none in the Fourth.

The last syllable in each 11110 is common z in the third and fourth lines
however a line ending in a short vowel is distinctly rare, such an ending
not having sufficient weight.

In the first six Odes of the Third Book which consist of 84 stanzas
a short vowel occurs at the end of the third line 5 times and at the end of
the fourth only once (3. 1. 40 atra Oura).

ξ 2. Synaphaea prevails : that is to say, a line ending in m or a vowel
(especially a short vowel) or diphthong is rarely followed by a 11110
beginning with a vowel, the lines 111 03011 stanza. being linked together.

There are in all 20 exceptions: e.9. 1. 9. 7 Sabina Ι o ; 9. 14 lucro Ι
appone ; 16. 27 amicit Ι opprobriis. In Books III. and IV. only these six
occur: 3. 2. 17 sordidae Ι intaminatis; 4. 9 Apulo} altrimzu 5. 10 toqae

Horace by lengthening the fifth foot in lines 1. 2. 3 and resolutely avoiding the
use of two trochaic words at the end of line 3 has largely altered its character.
