cave: and so Ep. 1. 13. 19, but cave Epod. 6. 113 Ep. 1. 6. 32: cf.
vide sis Pers. 1. 108 and puta 2. 5. 32; Pers. 4. 9. These shortenings are
a relic of the old freedom of the dramatists‚ who allowed a long syllable to be
shortened by the influence of the tone on another. The pronunciation cau is
not on the whole so probable though supported by the story in Cic. de Div.
2. 40. 84 where cauueas is made=cave ue eas. faxis: Roby S. G. 291.
3. 39. pudor malus, ⁴ false shame.' angit, a very strong word:
ἄγχει, ἀπάγχει are so used.

43. cumque belongs to the first quem, as well as to the second. Observe
mala before st, 1. 10. 72. 44. Chrysippus: 1. 3. 127. porticus:
the στοὰ ποικίλη at Athens, where Zeno lectured, whence the name Stoic.

mat, ‘names ⁹: an archaic word common in Plautus: once in Terence 3 not
used by Cicero. formula (ὅρος, κανών), ‘ definition.’

51. variis partibus: a pregnant instrumental ablative, ‘by leading
them in different directions‚’ lit. ‘by different directions.’ 53. caudam
trahat: Porph. is probably right in saying that this is derived from the
custom of children tying a tail (a dish-clout 2) to those they wished to make
fun of. 54. nihilum metuenda: ‘nihilum here used adverbially.
timentis: the simplest way is to take this as masc„ ‘ of the man who fears ' ;
so ruentis in 57, and we thus get a personal nom. to queratur and audierit
(60), or we may say that Horace passes imperceptibly from the general idea
of ‘ folly that fears ' to the ‘ fool who complains‚’ etc. 55. campo, ‘ a plain,'
not the Campus Martius here.

56. varum, ‘differing from ’ ; the dat. is like meretrici dispar Ep. 1. 18.
33 so differi sermoni 1. 4. 48. varus, prop. of men with the legs bent out
from the kneeS, ‘knock·kneed‚’ opp. vatius and walqusz hence ‘ distorted,
crooked, diverging.' 57. amica mater, ‘ his loving mother‚’ φίλη μήτηρ.
amica is used with emphasis as the first word, to point out that the madman
might well listen to the voice of those who naturally must have friendly feel-
ings towards him. The punctuation of some editors amica, mater (‘ his mis-
tress‚’ ‘his mother ') shows little taste and destroys the balance of the sentence.
58. honesta, ‘honoured‚' ‘ virtuous.’ 59. Serva, ‘take heed! ' ‘look out! ’
φυλάττου, a common exclamation in Plautus and Terence. 60. Fufius,
an actor. 61. cum Ilionam edormit, ‘while sleeping through the part
of Iliona.’ edormit, pres„ the usual tense with dum in sense of ‘ while‚' after
past 1611565, and sometimes, see line 277, with cum in that sense. Iliona was
the eldest daughter of Priam. married to Polymestor, king of Thrace, by whom
she had a 5011 Deiphilus or Deipylus. Her young brother Polydorus was
committed to her charge, and she changed him and her 5011 Deiphilus, repre-
senting Polydorus to be her son. When Polymestor was bribed to slay Poly-
dorus, he accordingly slew his own son Deiphilus. Pacuvius, the tragedian,
made this the subJ'ect of his tragedy ‘ Iliona,' in which the murdered Deiphilus
appeared to his sleeping mother Iliona, and addressed her in these words:
mater, te adpelle, tu, quae curam somno suspensum levas, Ι ‘neque te mei miseret,
surye et sepeli quatum tuum priusquam ferae . . . Iliona should have sprung
from sleep, and replied aye, adsta, mane, audi! iteradum eadem istaec mihi l
