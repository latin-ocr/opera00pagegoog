contractioris are used—

Od. = Odes. G. S. = Cama Saeculare. Ep. = Epistles.

ODES.——BOOK I

ODE I

Tffls Ode is introductory to the first three Books ε in it Horace apologises at
some length for attempting lyric poetry, and briefly dedicates his compositione
to Maecenas. Nauck suggests that the two first and two last lines were not in
the original Ode, but were added when the poet dedicated his writings to
Maecenas. If they are omitted the Ode is left perfect as an introductory Ode,
and the division of the stanzas becomes much more clearly marked, the first
six beginning with sunt quos, hunc, yawdentem, luctantem, est qui, multos,
which look like the first words of three pairs of carefully balanced stanzas.

‘ Many and varim are the pwsuits and arms of men to which they ἀνίης]
τεηαοίοωίῃ, ¹qlory, wealth, ease, war, sport .· I, with the help of heaven, {0⁹29
to be a lyric poet, and if you, Maecenas, consider me one, I shall have attained
the heiylzt of my ambition.’

1. Maecenas. C. Cilnius Maecenas, ‘ sprung from a royal lineage,' was of
Etrurian origin, his ancestors being Lucumones or chieftains at Arretium: cf.
3. 29. 1 Tyrrhena reqwm, progenies ; S. 1. 6. 1. atavis: the order is pater,

tores, 3. sunt quos . . . iuvat: lit. ‘there are (those) whom it delights‚’
πλε. ‘ some take a pleasure in . . . ' sunt qui may be followed by either the
subj. or ind. ε with the subj. it means ‘ there are (men) of such a character
that ² (cf. Ep. 2. 2. 182); with the ind. it is much more definite, and the two
words almost coalesce into a single word: ‘ some ’ (cf. Gk. ἔστιν οἵ declined
as a single word). 4. collegisse. The phrase ‘to have collected Olympio
dnst ' refers to the clouds of dust raised by the chariots in the arena, with
which the competitors would be covered. The perfect because men delight
not merely in doing, but in having] done a feat ; cf. 3. 4. 52 ; 18. 15.

5. palma. A wreath of wild olive (κότινος) was the prize at Olympia,
but a branch of palm was also carried by victors in all the gameS. The
Romans introduced the practice B.o. 293, and palma is very common:
‘victory.’ In Christian times the palm is a sign of those who have won the
prize of martyrdom. 6. terrarum dominos: either (l) agreeing with
deos (cf. Ov. ex Ponto 1. 9. 36 terrarum dominos quam colis ipse deos), or (2)
acc. after evehit ‘ eggltbsjomheaven (thinking themselves) lords of the world ’ ;
cf. Lucan 8. 208 terrarum dominos: ‘princes.' Against (1) it may be
urged that there seems no reason for calling the gods here ‘lords of the
world,’ and that the phrase evehit ad deos is complete in itself, cf. 4.
