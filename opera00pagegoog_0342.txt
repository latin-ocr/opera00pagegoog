‘ Wealtli and palaces avail not ,· when once inevitable Fate dooms thee,

save Rome 7777737 have couraye to curb 7170 license of 7170 day and so win
fame for after 07963, since in his own 0796 alas! he will not, sor we hate merit.
Nor will words avail ; stern and 3770779 repression is needed now, when men

In its general purpose the Ode may be compared with Odes 1-6 of this Book.

Porphyrion's comment ‘luxuriam . . . non terram tantum verum etiam maria
occupantem ' shows that he did not read Tyrrhenum. Ponticum and Apuli-

publicum must be right and j0ined with Porphyrion's comment involves the

where elavos trabaleszadamantinos clavos here, the ‘ nail ' being symbolical
of that which is fixed and immutable. When the rich man has laid his
