Erls'rrr. 11 NOTES 581

speaking here of coines-ny new terms, but of 6 writer adopting and so stamping
with his sanction those which have but lately become current, aud are not
yet recognised as classical. Hence adsciscet which is used of admitting
strangers to the franchise, or recruits into a legion. ‘N ew phrases, in the
world of books unknown, Ι So use but father them, 116 makes his σπη’-0011.

120. vemens: cf. line 28 n. The poet must have the swift strong rush
of a full stream, without losing clearness and purity of style. Cicero, Brut.
79. 274, says of M. Calidius primum ita pura erat (oratio), ut nihil liquidius,
ita libere fluebat, ut ‘nusquam adhaeresceret. 122. luxuriantia: sc. verba,
of a redundancy in style, compared to the rank growth of trees not duly pruncd,
a metaphor which is also kept up by conpeseet. cf. Virg. G. 2. 370 ramos com-
pesce fluentes ,· 1. 112 luxuriem segetum tenera depascit iu herba ,· Cic. de Orat.
2. 23. 96 luxuries stilo depascenda est (i.e. must be kept down by the practice
of writing); Quintil. 10. 4. 1 lumbo-‘lautia adstriuyere . . . duplicis operae.
sano, ie. one which does not emasculate: cf. A. P. 26. 123. virtute,
not ‘ merit,’ but rather ⁶ energy, vigour.' The other faults can be set right:
this admits of nothing but complete excision. ‘But show no mercy to an
empty line'—Pope. 124. ludentis, ‘ of one in sport.' et torquebitur,
‘and yet he will exert himself to the utmost.’ As the proverb has it, ‘easy
writing makes hard reading‚' so a writer to seem at his ease, must put forth
all his powers. One of the most striking illustrations is Addison’s style, which
attaincd its consummate ease only after the most careful revision. Pope has
again caught the point admirably: ‘ But ease in writing flows from art, not
chance, Ι As those move easiest who have learn’d to dance.' The apparent ease
of motion of the trained dancer is due only to long-continued effort. 125.
Satyrum . . . movetur: Roby 1120 (α), S. G. 469 ; cf. S. 1. 5. 63 saltaret
Cyclopa. The Satyr would dance lightly, the Cyclops heavily and clumsily.

126-140. Α man who is labouriuq under α delusiou may be a very happy
man, and it is not always kim& to dispel it. 126. praetulerim . . .
ringi: Horace has been throughout proving to Florus why he must expect
no poems from him. Here he argues that as great exertions are necessary
to success, le jeu ne ‘aaut pas la chaudelle. There are some people who are
blissfully unconscious of the worthlessness of their own productione, and live
in 6 pleasing state of sels-satisfaction. This he confesses‚ with some irony, to
be the happier state. But it is over for him now. He is like a man who has
been cured of an agreeable delusion, and restored to the hard realities of life.
He knows he cannot write good poetry without an effort‚ and it is not worth
his while to make it. It seems therefore that there is no need of a note of
interrogation at ri‘nyi, as Kriiger aud others print. praetulerim : Roby
1540, S. G. 644 (b). 128. ring-i, ‘to be worried’ ε cf. Ter. Phorm. 2. 2. 27
dum tibi fit quod placeat, ille ringitur .· riuqi is to show the teeth, used of
an angry dog. Here the meaning is to be vexed with a sense of failure.

128. haud ignobilis: quidam may be understood fiom the relative in
the next line. Argis: the Romans changed Ἀργος into Argi on the
analogy of names like Delphi, Veii, Gabii etcff, and perhaps misunderstanding
the termination as an acc. plur. No form but Arqis is found for the dat. and
abl.; the gen. does not occur: the acc. Amos is usually masc. plur. (perhaps
always in the historians) as Virg. Aen. 2. 95 patrios ad Amos .· but occasion—
ally neuter, as Od. 1. 7. 9 aptwm. dicit equis Arqos (so in ovid, but not in
Virg.) 130. sessor, ‘sitting regularly ’ 3 cf. Jnv. 14. 86. 133. igno·
scere servis : for reluctance to do this treated as a sign of insanity cf. S. 1.
