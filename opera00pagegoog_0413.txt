true reading, nor is the ellipse of fiat too hard. Many edd. adopt qui, but
all spoil it by placing a comma after nemo, so that the meaning would be, ‘ how
is it that no one, like the avarus, is satisfied‚’ as if it were true that the
avarus is satisfied: for to take ut avarus=ut neque avarus (se probat) seems
impossible. Two other readings need notice-—( 1) nemon ut avarus: this has,
numerically, the highest MS. sanction, and is adopted by many edd. But
such an exclamation is out of place at the end of a grave argument, and would
·mean Just the opposite of what is required. The real meaning os nemori ut
avarus must be : ‘ can it be thought that no avarus is satisfied ’.ἱ ’ the answer
demanded being: ‘ certainly not: the avariae is sometimes satisfied.' Of.

one. (2) nemo ut avarus has but poor authority, and introduces a startling
hiatus (cf. however Epod. 13. 3; Od. 1. 28. 24). Moreover the acc. and
infin. would be expected, not ut with subj. Lastly, the point Horace started
with was not the statement that the avarus was discontented, but a question,
how it comes that this is the case. avarus: the insertion of this word
here is necessary to fuse Horace’s two subjects into one; see Intr. 110.

Satire was written after the publication of Georgic I. ; but it is just as likely
that Virgil copied Horace. carceribus, the barriers, behind which the

struggle for first place, but being passed by, relaxes his efforts, loses his place,

describes of beaten horses falling back.

According to the scholiasts Crispinus was a verbose ἀρεταλὰγος (professor of
