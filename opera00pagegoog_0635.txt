times. 210. placari Genius: a Latin idiom (cf. Ep. 2. 1. 143; Od. 3.
17. 15 curabis Genium), but this does not show that Horace is necessarily
thinking only of Rome. inpune: non contradicente aut teye aut moribus
—Acron, ‘ with no fear of blame or punishment.’ 211. numerisque mo-
disque: cf. Ep. 2. 2. 144. 212. liber laborum: cf. Virg. Aen. 10. 154
libera fati ‚· Lucan 6. 301 libem teyum Roma ; Od. 3. 17. 16 ope‘mwn solutis.
213. turpis honesto: special scats in the theatre (the orchestra) were not
assigned even to senators before 194 B.c. 3 ef. Livy 34. 54 z for the lea· Roscia

cf. Ep. 1. 1. 62.

214. sic, quia indoctus erat populus—Acron. motum and luxuriem
seem naturally to describe ⁶ rapid (musical) movements ' and ‘ florid variations,'
but Orelli and others, referring to Cic. de Leg. 2. 49 and Arist. Poet. 26 where
extravagant gestures on the part of players are condemned, so explain the
words here. 216. voces, ‘ notes.' crevere: according to the current
story the harp had but four strings at first, and this number was increased
to seven by Terpander (flor. 670-640 B.c.), and to ten by Timotheus (fl. 420-
380). severis: the music of the harp was always regarded as much
graver and less passionate than that of the flute, and therefore was the only
music allowed by Plato in his ideal State. 217. tulit, ‘ produced‚’ i.e.
brought along with it, as in Virg. Aen. 10. 792 fidem latura vetustas.
eloquium, a poetical form for eloquentia, used by Virg. Aen. 11. 383 tona
eloquio ; J uv. 10. 114, and in later prose. The abruptness of the transition
from the music to the diction of the chorus, led Ribbeck to consider lines
217-219 spurious: but it is not out of place to note the change in language as
well. The language of the chorus became, like its music, no longer simple
but bombastic and oracular (i.e. unintelligible). praeceps, ι1)01(1,’ ‘ daring '3
cf. Quint. 12. 10. 73 vitiosum et corruptum dicendi glenus . . . quodfflaeoipitia
pro sublimibus habet. 218. sagax, ‘skilled in, ' with gen. as in Columell. 1.
praef. 22 semaei-§simus ‘rerum naturae. divina futuri: cf. Od. 3. 27.10
imbrium divina avis. 219. sortilegis. divination by sortes, strictly speaking,
was not practised at Delphi, although it was at Dodona, and especially 111
Italy at Praeneste and Antium: but the term was commonly extended to any
utterance of an oracle, as in Virg. Aen. 4. 346 Iayciae sortes ; Ov. Met. 3. 130
Phoebeis sortibus ; Cic. de Div. 2. 56. 1 5, where sors is used of the answer
sent from Delphi to Croesus. n discrepuit sententia Delphis,
‘ 3 compressed comparisonss for sententiae Delphorum .· expressions like ‘that of ’
are avoided in Latin, either by such compression or by the repetition of the sub-
stantive3 ef. Od. 2. 6. 14 11. ; Cic. de Orat. 1. 4. 15 11. ; Mayor on Juv. 3. 74.

220- 224. The satyrio drama developed out of traqedy‚ ami was intended to
amase the spectatore towards the close of the day. 220. vilem ob hircum.
although the derivation of τραγῳδία from ϊράγος,ι 3 he· -goat,’ because this was
the prize offered for success in it, is now abandoned by the best authorities,
who derive the word rather from the goat— —like appearance of the chorus, who
were dressed as Satyrs, it was that generally adopted by the ancients· ‚ and
there is no doubt that a goat was regularly offered in sacrifice to Bacchus (cf.
Virg. Gr. 2. 380) and that this goat was assigned as the prize to the leader of
the victorious chorae. 221. mox etiam: Aristotle (Poet. 4. 17 διὰ τὸ ἐκ
σατυρικοῢ μεταβαλεῖν) represents tragedy as oriyinatinq in the song of a band
of men dressed as satyrs. Kiessling holds that Horace either did .not know
or reJects this view. But the fact seems to be that while tragedy origin-
ated in the song of a band of satyrs, yet, as it developed, the chorus
