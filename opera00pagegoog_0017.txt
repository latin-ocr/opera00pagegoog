INTRODUGTION xi

(corpusculum) and that 11 1110 ‘roll' (volumen) were rounder it
would be more like its author.

His writings 1311 11110 two divisions:

(1) Lyric poems—the Epodes, the Odes, and the Carmen
Saeculare. -

(2) The Satires, the Epistle8‚ and the Ars Poetica.

The Epodes and the Satires both belong to the first half of his
career, his other poems to the second. Up to the battle of Actium
(31 B.c.) he perhaps still clung to the republican dreams 01 1113
youth3 at any rate up to that period his writings are without
political colour,1 but after it he not only ceases 10 be neutral‚ but
becomes definitely 3 supporter of the new monarchy and, especially
in the odes, deliberately places his poetical powers at its
disposal.

The Satires consist 01 3 number 01 poems in hexameter verse
in two BookS‚ the first of which was published about 35 B.c.‚ 1110
30001111 about 30 110. Whatever the origin of the word satura or
satira, 2 31 any rate ‘Satire,' as a form of poetry in our modern
sense 01 1110 word, has the distinction of being the only branch 01
Roman literature which was not formed on a Greek model.3 Its
inventor was Lucilius (148—103 Β. C. )‚ and it reached its perfectiori
in Juvenal (flor. A.D. 100). The Satires of Lucilius attack indi-
viduals with the unsparing freedom of the old Greek comedy 3 those
of Juvenal glow with the 1110 01 3 fierce indignation. The Satires
of Horace on the other hand are free from vehemence 3 they keep
entirely clear of politics and deal chiefly with social 1011103, 1110 writer
finding in the faults and 1011103 01 mankind the occasion not for anger
but for laughter. At the same time this laughter must not be mis-
interpreted3 it is in no sense cynical or contemptuous but is used
deliberately. Horace knew that he was not adapted for a
preacher or a prophet, but he was admirably qualified to make
vice appear ridiculous and to show the fool his own foolishness.

The Epistles consist 01 two books, the first of which was
published about 20 Β.0., while the second consists 01 only two
Epistles‚ of which the first is assigned to 13 Β.0. and the second
