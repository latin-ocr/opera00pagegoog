having sprung from the foam of the sea (Ἀφροδίτη, ἀφρός) 8116 was supposed
to influence the waves ; cf. Venus marina 3. 26. 5 ; 4. 11. 15.

2. fratres Helenae. Cf. Macaulay: ‘Safe comes the ship to harbour Ι
Through billows and through gales‚ Ι If once the great Twiu Brethren 1 Sit
chiniuy on her sails.’ In thundery weather a pale-blue flame is sometimes
seen playing round the masts of ships, and it was held to indicate the presence
of the Dioscuri and the safety of the ship. Italian mariners call it the fire of
St. Elmo. On coins, etc.‚ Castor and Pollux are represented with a star on
their foreheads. lucida sidera: cf. 4. 8. 31. 4. obstrictis aliis
praeter Iapyga, ‘ keeping all but Iapyx bound in prison. ' For the
prison-house in which Aeolus guards the winds see Virg. Aen. 1. 52 seq.
Iapyx is to be let loose because blowing from the Iapygian promontory in
Apulia it would waft the traveller from Brundisium to Dyrrachium, from
which he would coast along past Corcyra and then down the Gulf of Corinth.
Thence he might pass by land to Athens, or else the ship might be dragged
across the Isthmus of Corinth (cf. δίολκος) and sail into the Peiraeus. A
voyage round C. Matapan would be very exceptional. aliis, ‘others‚'
would usually be ceteri-3, ‘the others‚' ‘ the rest!

5. creditum. Notice the same metaphor in debes, reddas, incolumem.
9. robur et aes triplex, ‘Oak and triple brass,' cf. 3. 16. 2 11. For a
similar metaphor, cf. Aesch. Prom. 242 σιδηρόφρων τε κάκ πέτρας εἰργασμένος.
10. trag-ilem truci: J'uxaposition to emphasise the antithesis, Cf. too pelago
ratem, and 2. 4. 6 n. 12. praecipitem (prae-caput, ‘head foremost')‚
coming down in sudden squalls z cf. καταιγίζειν ; Luke viii. 23 κατέβη λαῖλαψ.

13. decertantem. The preposition gives the force of fighting it cut to
the cml.- Horace has a special fondness for these compoundS, cf. 1. 9. 11
deproelianteS, 1. 18. 9 debellata, 3. 3. 55 debacchentur, 1. 33. 3 decantes,
Ep. 1. 3. 14 desaevit. 14. Hyadas. Seven stars in the head of Taurus
which portended rain or storm. The prose term for them was Suculae, ‘ the
litter of little pigs‚' from ὓς, ὑός, sue. The poets reject so natural and vulgar
an etymology, and connect with ὕειν, ‘ to rain.' 15. arbiter Hadriae,
‘lord of the Adriatie.’ cf. 2. 17. 19 tyr-annua and 3. 3. 5 dux, both used
of the wind’s ‘mastery' over the sea. Arbiterzad-biter from ad and bito,
an obsolete word: ‘to go,' from root of βαίνω. An ‘ arbiter ' therefore=0ne
who is present (so in Milton ‘the moon sits arbitress ' ; Epod. 5. 50), then
‘one who stands by to witness and judge.' Here used of the wind, with
whom it rests to decide whether there shall be storm or calm. 16. tollere
seu ponere vult freta. The first seu is omitted for convenience, as often
in poetry: cf. 1. 6. 19 ; 32. 7, and similar omissions of εἴτε and οὔτε 111 Gk.
Translate ‘ whether he wish to rouse or calm the sea. ' The winds are said to
calm the sea by'a curious idiom which speaks of them as causing that which
their absence causes. So Soph. Aj. 674 δεινῶν ἄημα πνευμάτων ἐκοίμισε Ι
στένοντα πόντον. ffeta=fflth or firth.

17. quem gradum, ‘what approach of death 2 ' ‘what form of death's
approach 2 ' 18. siccis oculiss, i. e. without weeping. For tears of terror
cf. Hom. Od. 20. 349 δακρυόφιν πίμπλαντο, of the eyes of the panio-stricken
81111018. 22. prudens, i.e. providens, ‘in his providence.' dissocia-
bili: most adjectives in -abilis are passive, but not unfrequently the poets
use them actively‚ and so here dissociabiliszquae dissociat ‘ dividing. ’ Cf. 2.
14. 6 inlacrimabilem Plutona ‘who does not weep‚' but 4. 9. 26 inlacrima-

biles ‘unwept for.' So flebilis 4. 2. 21 ‘weeping,' but l. 24. 10 flebilior ‘more
