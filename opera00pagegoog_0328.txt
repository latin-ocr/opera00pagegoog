inmanis not only means ‘ immeasurable,' but also ‘ awful,' ‘horrible,' and the
description of hell as inmanis aula: ‘the vast and dreadful hall ’ 15 clear,

whereas aula by itself could refer to nothing.

18. eius. This pronoun 15 only found once elsewhere in the Odes (4. 8.
18, a very doubtful passage), and 15 extremely rare in other poets, doubtless
as being weak and unemphatic. Here it 15 apparently meaningless and might
be omitted. These facts and the consideration that lines 17-20 dwell tediously
and unnecessarily on some rather unpoetical qualities of Cerberus induce
many to consider the whole stanza an interpolation due to some one who
considered that the words inmanis . . . aulae would not be clear without
the addition of the name ‘ Cerberus‚’ and accordingly manufactured a stanza
containing that name. However, though certainly not Horatian, it is im-
possible to 055011 that the stanza is not Horace's. For the power of music
