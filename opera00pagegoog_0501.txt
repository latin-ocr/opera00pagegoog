to meet him on 'Change to-morrow.’ We do not know what Roscius this was.
The words are those of some slave or friend of Roscius. The imperf. is used
quite regularly, much in the same way as it is used in letter-writing, save that
in the latter case the writer prOJects himself in imagination forward to the
time when the letter is delivered, Madv. 345. Here there is no such projection,
and the imperf. is really a more natural tense than our present. Cf. Aristoph.

nianum, the Roman Exchange. puteal was a wall put round a well, to save
people from falling in ε then puteal was applied to an erection of similar shape
placed round a sacred spot. A chapel in the Forum had been struck by
lightning, and one Scribonius Libo (probably as aedile) expiated it, and put a
puteal round it. About this puteal the business men of Rome congregated.
A coin of the Scribonia gens, with a representation of the puteal on it, is in
the British Museum, and is figured in Smith’s Dict. Ant. Cf. Ep. 1. 19. 8

generally of humble rank, often freedmen. They were, however, honestus ordo,
Cic. Verr. 3. 793 and Cic. speaks of them immediately after the senate and
equites, pro Domo sua, 28. 74. They were probably permanently attached to
the offices of the high magistrates in Rome, especially the quaestors and aediles,
and must have been very numerous. In the Satires, besides Horace himself,
we find mentioned as scribae Aufidius Luscus, Sarmentus, and Coranus. The
other sense of scriba, viz. a private secretary, does not occur in the Satires,
The scribae regard Horace as still one of themselves, hence communi. Plaut.

upon with great fear, on account of its being affixed to requisitions for
money: Maecenatis rana per collationes pecuniarum in maqno terrore erat.

that he had been intimate with Maecenas nearly eight years. This Satire
having been written at the very end of 31 or beginning of 30, this will make
his intimacy with Maecenas to have begun in the spring of 38 B.c., which quite
agrees with the probable date of the journey to Brundisium in the autumn of
that year (Con. rightly renders ε ‘ Seven years, or rather eight ’). 42. dum-
