ron-nm NOTES 623

have been carried to heaven, but that the trick was discovered when one of his
bronze sandals was cast up by the volcano. 464. deus: cf. Emped. frag.
χαίρετ’, ἐγὼ δ’ ὔμμιν θεὸς ἄμβροτος, οὐκέτι θνητός. Empedocles was a strong
believer in metempsychosis, and this may have been distorted into the basis of
such a charge. 465. frig-idus, ‘in cold blood‚' Joeularly contrasted with
ardentem. Acron has ‘ in his folly ' : ‘Empedocles enim dicebat tarda ingenia
frigido circa praecordia sanquine impediri ' (his own line is αἷμα ’γὰρ ἀνθρώ-
ποις περικάρδιόν ἐστι νόημα), but the reference seems too obscure to be intended
here. 467. idem occidenti: for the dat. ‘the same with,' ⁶ the same as '
cf. Lucret. 3. 1038 eadem aliis sopitu' quietes& 4. 1174 eadem facit . . . omnia
tmjpi ‘she does, in all thing& the same as the ugly woman,''Roby 1142. Seneca
Phoen. 100 has occidere est vetare cupientem morel, an exaggerated imitation, for
Horace only means that in each case violence is done to the wishes of the person
concerned. This is the only spondaic hexameter in Horace. 468. iam, ‘ at
once' with flet. 469. famosae, ‘notorious' ; ef. Ep. 1. 19. 32.

470. cur, i.e. what sin he has committed, in consequence of which the
gods have sent upon him this frenzy. 471. bidental: when a place was
struck with lightning, it was the custom condere fulmen, with a sacrifice of
sheep (bidentes), andto enclose the spot with a wall. Another derivation quod
bis fulmine percmsmn est is evidently wrong, though Acron prefers it. 4¹73. ,
valuit, common in poetry for potuit, ‘has succeeded in bursting.' Roby 1454,
S. G. 591. 2. 476. non missura . . . hirmin, ‘like a leech, which will
not let go ’ : the simile passes into a metaphor‚ as often in Horace z cf. Ep. 1. 2. 42.
