218 HORACE Book 1

said to have added, among other qualities, a portion of the wath os the Zion.
Passion ha's ever proved rainone .· I too was aryed by it to make my libellous
attacks, which I am now eayer to recant!

This Ode is a παλινῳδία or ‘recantation‚' cf. recantatis line 27. Τ110 most
famous palinode is the one referred to Epod. 17. 42-44, and some amuse
themselves by finding the original of the criminosi iambi in that Epode.

3. pones: 2nd pers. fut. for a polite imperative. ponere modum=to put
a limit to them, i. e. destroy them. There is also a suggestion that the
iambics had been without modus, Emit, measure, moderation. iambis:

Archilochus is said to have invented the iambic, and to have employed it in ·

his well-known lampoons 3 cf. A. P. 7 9 and note. 3, 4. sive flamma Ι
sive. Of. N otes on Metres p. xviii. ἓ 4.

5. Dindymene. The goddess who dwells by Mount Dindymus in
Phrygia, i.e. Cybele. non adytis . . . ‘ nor does its Pythian inhabitant
equally shake (or terrify) the mind of his priests in (or perhaps ‘by means
of ³) his inmost shrine.' adytis goes in construction partly with incola, partly
with quatit. The ἄδυτον (‘ unenterable place ') was a small cavern in which
was a deep cleft in the rock, over which was placed the tripod 011 which the
priestess sat, cf. Munro on Lucr. 1. 738. For the effects of inspiration on the
priestess, cf. Virg. Aen. 6. 47 seq. The spelling with y shows that this is
not a word of Latin development, but a Greek word in Latin letters. ι
Latin had no symbol for the Greek sound υ (which is intermediate between
Latin a, pronounced as oo 111 ‘boot,' and short i), and therefore at a late
period, as is shown by its late position in the alphabet‚ introduced the letter
Y, ΞΤ, which is therefore only found in pure Greek words, eg. lyra, amystide,
Cybele, tyrannus, lyncas, etc„ but lacruma or lacrima. 7. acuta, ⁶ shrilly-
sounding‚’ ‘piercing.’ · 8. geminant, ‘ clash'3 well illustrated by Lucr.
2. 635, where the Corybantes are said pulsare aeribus aera.

9. tristes ut irae. The ‘at goes after aeque, the words non acaia . . .
aera coming in parenthetically and by way of illustration rather than
forming part of the main thought and construction. irae z 111 plural, ‘ out-
bursts of passion ' 3 cf. Virg. Ecl. 2. 14 tristes Amaryllidis iras. Noricus :
the district of Noricum (about the Tyrol) was celebrated for its iron. 11.
tremendo Iuppiter . . . ‘ nor heaven itself falling with dread confusion!
Jupiter, the god of the sky (see 1. 1. 25 n.), is put for the sky itself, and
ruens (as in Virg. G. l. 324 ruit arduus aether) expresses that heaven itself
seems to' be rushing in thunder, and lightning, and rain, down upon the earth.
For the rapid rhythm Iuppiter ipse ruens see Notes on Metres p. xix. ἓ 5.
Here* it is used purposely to express the quick descent of the deluge.

13. fertur Prometheus . . . Either supply esse after coactus, and J'oin
coactas esse and apposuisse by ei, or else make coactus a participle and et=
etiam, ⁶ along with ' or ⁴ among the rest.’ Prometheus is by no means always
the rebellious Titan of Aeschylus, but he and his brother Epimetheus are
often two allegorical figures, ‘ Forethought ' and ‘Afterthought.' In the story
here alluded to, Afterthought had used up all the qualities, with which living
creatures after being moulded in clay were to be endowed, before he came to
man at all, and then Forethought being called in to remedy this was com-
pelled (coactus) to take a small portion of their qualities from each animal,
with the result that man possesses a composite character showing traces of the
various qualities which specially belong to different animals. See Plat. Prot.
