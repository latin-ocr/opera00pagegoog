expression which, in view of line 7 of this Epistle, may be explained either by
poetic modesty, or by the hypothesis of a subsequent addition to his property
by the favour of Messala, his patron. The tone of the two (genuine) extant
books of his elegies confirms the impression of his character which we derive

learning or force of expression. Od. 1. 33 18 also addressed to him. The
date of the Epistle cannot be precisely determined, but it may be safely
placed within the limits assigned to the Epistles generally, 24- 20 Β. c.
