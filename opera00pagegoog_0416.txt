wise man is a king, and anything and everything he chooses 2 120-133. Yet
in spite of your kingship you are the mock of boys in the streets, and no one
does you homage but the pedant Crispinus, more silly than yourself ε while Ι,
111 spite of my folly, shall enjoy the company of many sweet friends, forgiving
and forgiven by them 111 turn, 133-142.

2. cantare: to be joined with inducant animum rather than with royati.
3. Sardus: contemptuously, cf. l. 2. 3 n. Calvus the friend of Catullus
assailed this Tigellius in scazons, of which Porph. has preserved one line,
Sardi Tigelli putidum caput venit .· ‘for sale, the duffer TigelliuS.’ habe-
bat . . . hoc: cf. Cic. Phil. 2. 32. 78 habebat hoc omnino Caesar, ‘this was
a way of Caesar's.' 4. Caesar: AugustUS, at this time C. Julius Caesar
Octavianus. He did not receive the title of Augustus until 27 B.c.‚ but
assumed the name of Caesar immediately after the murder of his great-uncle
Julius in 44, on hearing of his adoption by the latter in his will. qui
cogere posset-,2 a compliment to the power of Octavian, sure to please him
at this time when he had still Sextus Pompey, Lepidus, and Antonius to sub-
due before becoming master of the world. patris: Julius, great-uncle of
Augustus, but adoptive father. The imperfects posset, peteret, proficeret,
citaret are used instead of pluperfects owing to a mental retrospect, as not
uncommonly: see Madvig 247. 2.

6. si collibuisset, ‘if the whim had seized him.’ ab ovo ad. mala:
eggs were included among the things eaten at the beginning of a dinner ; cf.
Cic. ad Fam. 9. 20 iozteyram samem ad ovum adfero. They did not form a part
of the cena proper, but were called promulsis, quattus, or gustatio. The cena
proper consisted of two or three courses (fercula) followed by dessert (mensae
secundae), which would include ‘ apples? 7. citaret : ‘ recite.’ Io
Bacchae τ cf. Eur. Bacch. 577 κλύετ’ ἐμᾶς κλύετ’ αὐδᾶς, ἰὼ Βάκχαι, ἰὼ Βάκχαι.
Τ1113 seems to have been a well known recitative. The MSS. are pretty evenly
divided between Bacchae and Bacche, but the extreme rarity of the lengthen-
ing of a short vowel-ending (exceptions are duplicate ·que, and mavia Aen. 3.
464, anima 12. 648) must decide in favour of Bacchae. This Palmer now
adopts, though 116 formerly defended Bacche on the ground that in this particu-
lar hymn the accent in singing probably fell on the last syllable. summa
voce, ‘with deepest voice,’ while ima: ‘ highest.' Τ116 Greeks and Romans
reversed our system. The old simple tetrachord had four strings ε νήτη,
παρανήτη, παρυπάτη, ὑπάτης of these the highest string‚ ὑπάτη, summa, was
the most bass ; the lowest, νεάτη, νήτη, ima, was the most treble. 8.
resonat: for ‘resonare of musical accompaniment‚ cf. od. 3. 11. 3. qua e
chordis quattuor ima, ‘in that note in which the lowest of the four strings
resounds.' qua 6 for quaeis Palmer’s emendation. It is no change, for in
MSS. of Horace’s time words were not separated, nor is there anything unusual
in the elision qua 6 ; cf. 2. 1. 71, where se is elided before a 3 l. 1. 44 'ni before
id 3 1. 2. 100 quae before invidean253 Prop. 4. 2. 57 te qui ad vadimonia
curris. Reading quae the construction of chordis is very obscure. Orelli
suggests three explanations 2—(1) ima in chordi33 (2) chordis as instrumental
abl. 3 (3) chordis as dat. Schutz and Kiessling take chordis: ‘from the
strings‚’ but a preposition would be absolutely necessary. For 60663, of
musical noteS, see A. P? 216, Virg. Aen. 6. 646 septem discrimina vocum.

9. nil aequale, ‘he had no uniformity,' no consistency. velut qui

currebat. The construction is, saepe currebat velut qui fuyiens hostem (cur-
reret), saepe (incedebat) velut qui Iunonis sacra ferret. The reference is to the
