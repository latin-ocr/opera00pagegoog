ODE VI

‘ Your eaepZoits, A yrippa, would be a worthy theme for Varius: his βοείη]
is Honzeric. I am πού capable of treatirty a subject such as that os the Iliad .·
oue os my poor odes would but detract from your fame. Love aud levity alone
befit my inconstarit muse.' ,

M. Vipsanius Agrippa was the great minister of Augustus in war, as
Maecenas was in peace: Horace had probably been urged to celebrate his
victories‚ and finding the task uncongenial substitutes this dexterous apology.

1. scriberis Vario . . . alite, ‘ you shall be written about by
Varius as valiant and victorious, (by Varius) a bird of Homeric song.'
These lines present a distinct case of the abl. of the personal agent with-
out ab. Of. Ep. 1. 19. 3 quae scribuntur aquae potoribus ‘which are written
by water-drinkers ’; Ep. 1. 1. 94 curatus inaequali torisore,· Virg. Aen. 1. 312
uuo 9raditur comitatus Achate ‚· J uv. 13. 124 curentur dubii medicis maiori-
bus aeyri. On the other hand S. 2. 1. 84, iudice laudatus Caesare, may be
explained (see Mayor, Juv. 1. 13 n.)=iudicio Caesaris, and so Od. 3. 5.
24 Marte populata is simple, Marte being = betto. All editors try to
avoid this (1) by making Vario alite abl. abs. ‘when Varius takes a
ssight of Maeonio song,' but the position of alite prevents this ; or
(2) by altering to aliti and making a very ugly dat. of the agent. As
Horace, however, distinctly means ⁴ you shall be written of by Varius as
brave,' and all MSS. give the ablative, the facts are cogent. scriberisz
a peculiarly Horatian use of the future. ‘ You shall be written of,’ i.e. if you
will take my advice. So 1. 7. 1 laudabunt alii ‘ others shall praise‚' i.e. if
they wish3 1. 20. 1 vite potabis ‘you shall drink,' i.e. if you will accept my
invitation. Vario: for Varius as an epic poet cf. S. 1. 10. 43. 2.

Od. 1. 1 ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, Μοῦσα, πολύτροπον ὃς μάλα πολλὰ Ι πλάγχθη.
By rendering μῆνις ‘ wrath ’ as stomachus ‘bile‚' and πολύτροπος as duplex .
‘ cunning,' Horace humorously depreciates the epic style which he refuses
to attempt. Cf. Epod. 17. 12 homicidam Hectorem. Ulixei. The gen.
is from the hybrid form Utioeeus', which is declined as if of the 2nd
declension: cf. Achillei 1. 15. 34, Penthei 2. 19. 14, Alyattei 3. 16. 41.
