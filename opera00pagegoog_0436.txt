408 . · HORACE 11001( 1

Horace restricted this caesural lengthening to this case of verbs ending in -t,
while Virgil is much more lax. Horace, in the odes, lengthens arat 3. 16. 26 ;
ridet 2. 6. 143 flyit 3. 24. 53 perrupit 1. 3. 363 timet 2. 13. 16: periret
3. 5. 17 in thesis is doubtful. In the Satires we have defendit 1. 4. 82 ; subiit
1. 9. 21 3 vetit 2. 3. 187 ; ayit 2. 3. 260 3 erat 2. 2. 47 ; condiderit 2. 1. 82 ;
perhaps ageret 2. 3. 174. umeris is literally ‘on 1118 own shoulders,' but
the shoulders of the slaves are meant: cf. line 5 n. 3 1. 1. 47. 91. lapi-
dosus, ‘hard as a stone ' 3 others render ‘ gritty,' and lapidosus means both
‘full of stones,' as Z. terra Varr. R. R. 1. 9, and ‘ hard as a stone,' as Z. corna
Virg. Gr. 2. 34. Canusium (Canosa) was 84 miles from Beneventum.
urna is abl. ε ‘which place, not richer in water by a pitcher (or 1101 richer
by 3 pitcher of water), was founded.' Diomede is said 10 have been 1110
founder of Beneventum and Equus Tuticus also.

93. flentibus . . . amieis may be abl. abs„ but more probably is the
ethical dative, ‘ to the grief of his weeping ‘friends' hinc, ‘ at this point,’
viz. Canusium. Varius probably went back to Rome. 94. Rubi (Ruvo)
in one Itinerary 24, 111 another 30 miles from Canusium. 95. carpere iter,
viam, are common phrases, 2. 6. 93 ; Od. 2. 17. 12 ; Prop. 1. 6. 33 seu pedibus
terras seu pontum carpere remis. carpentes, present part. shows the
poverty of the Latin language : 3 perfect would be expected. 96. postera
tempestas for postridie tempestas, ‘the weather the next day.' 97.
Barium (Bari), 22 miles from Rubi, said 10 110 3 fishing station to this day.

97. Gnatia, a vulgar or local form for Eynatid, 37 miles from Barium 3
it is now Monopoli or Torre d' Anazzo. It was badly off sor water, hence
lymphis iratis exstructa, ‘ built in the anger of the water nymphs.’
lympha is the same word as nympha, and the words are often confounded in
MSS. In Varro, R. R. 1. 1. 6 Dstnpha is 3 water goddeSS‚ and Horace here
appears to use the word in that sense. Cf. 2. 3. 8 iratis natus paries dis atqu-e
poetis ; 2. 7. 14 Vertuwmis natus iniquis 99. A different version of the
miracle is given by Pliny, H. N. 2. 107. 240 reperitur apud auctores . . . ivi
Salentino oppido Eynatia inposito Ziyno i‘n saxum quoddam ibi sacrum pro-
tinus flammam exsistere. 100. cupit: 80. Gnatia. The town was proud
of its miracle. Iudaeus Apella: the Jews were regarded as specially
superstitious by the Romans 3 cf. Juv. 14. 96-106. Apella, a name of Greek
origin, perhaps corrupted from Apollodorus, often borne by slaves and freed-
men3 Cic. ad Fam. 7. 25. 2. 101. namque deos didici: copied from
Lucr. 5. 82 nam bene qui didicere deos securum 390φο aevum. For this belief
of the Epicuream and their attribution of miracles to natural causes, see Od.
1. 34 Intr. 102. nec, si quid miri . . . ‘and if nature does any wonder,
it is not the gods who, in their anger, send it down from their high home in
the sky.' 104. Brundisium (Brindisi), then, as now, the Dover of Italy,
with Dyrrhachium for the Calais of 010000, 44 1111108 from Egnatia.

According to Orelli, the whole journey took fifteen days, or seventeen days,
if we suppose the long stages between Barium and Egnatia, and between
Egnatia and Brundisium to have been broken at two places not mentioned by
Horace. According to E. Desjardins, who went over the route himself in 1852,
1110 Journey was completed in 13 days, but he supposes the travellers not to
have spent a night either at Capua 01· 31 Beneventum, but to have continued
their Journey in the afternoon to Caudium and Trivicum. Gibbon only
allowed ,12 days for the entire Journey. He does not suppose a night to have
been spent at Anxur. The following Table may be useful for reference :—
