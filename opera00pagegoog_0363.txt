Gannae; proruet and geret, future, because he foresees Zama (so Kiessling).

4. 352 ὀξὺν Ἀρηα. This concluding stanza is clearly a part of Hannibal’s
prophetie speech, and the strongly supported perficient is therefore better
than perficiunt of vet. Bland. Wickham urges that Horace ‘ would
hardly put into Hannibal’s mouth a dull prophecy of the glories of the
house of N er0.’ But why should we put into the poet's mouth this ‘dull
prophecy ' which Horace did not think good enough for Hannibal? As a
matter of fact the change from Hannibal to Horace at the end of along speech,
and that only for a single stanza, is extremely harsh ; it lowers the last four
lines to the level of the moral usually tacked on at the end of a versified fable.

ODE V

‘ Return‚ ,στοαί quardian of Rome, sor thou hast been absent too Zony .· return,
for thy presence is as snnshine, and thy country lonys for thee as anxiously as
a mother for her sailor lad's return. Thy presence brinys prosperity (17-20),
purity (21-24) and peace (25-28) ; every man lives under his own vine, and
after his eveniny meal honours thee with prayers and mathus, ranhiny thee
among] his household yods. “ L0n9 mayest thou preserve such joyous holiday
time for Italy ''—3uoh is οων morning and eveniny cry!

Augustus after the defeat of Lollius by the Sygambri 13.c. 16 (see 4. 2. 36
11.) went himself to Gaul and remained there until B.c. 13. This Ode is
written just before his return. Orelli remarks with justice on the wonderful
tranquillity and sense of assured peace and repose which characterise it.

1. divis orte bonis, ‘ born by heaven's favour‚’ divis bonis being abl. abS.,
cf. S. 2. 3. 8 iratis natus paries dis, Others render ‘ sprung from benignant
gods] Perhaps Horace purposely uses a phrase which suggests both ideas:
Augustus is at once a proof of heaven's favour and himself of heavenly race.
