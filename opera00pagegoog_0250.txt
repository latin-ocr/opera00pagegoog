222 HORACE Boon ·1

forbids me to sing] of wars or anythiuq but what coneerus herself. Quick,
alama, quielo! au altar aud a victims Zet us seek to soothe the auyry yoddess!

1. saeva: because of the noted cruelty of love. 2. Semelae. So most
MSS. and, though Gk. forms are usually preferred in the odes, there is no
need to accept the poorly-supported Semeles,· cf. Helenae 1. 3. 2 ; Epod. 17.
42. 4. finitis . . . ‘to devote myself again to the amours that (I had
hoped) were done with? 7. grata protervitas, ‘ charming petulance.'
8. lubricus aspici t epexegetic inf. necessary to explain the epithet lubricus

as applied to a face. As a road is too slippery for the feet to stand on, so
her face is too dazzling and deceptive for the eyes to rest on.

9. tota ruens Venus. Cf. Eur. Hipp. 443 Κύπρις γὰρ οὐ φορητόν, ἢν
πολλὴ ρυᾓ : the opposite of veniet leuior 11110 16. 11. versis animosum

equis, ‘ courageous with retreating steed.’ The sudden onset of the Parthian <

light cavalry and the showers of arrows they had been trained to pour into
the enemy while riding away (sayittas et celerem fuyam Parthi 2. 13. 17) had
been fatally experienced by the heavy·armed Roman legionaries 011 the sandy
plains of Oharrae and never forgotten. Of. Virg. G. 3. 31 fidentemque fuya
Parthum versisque sayittis. We use ‘ a Parthian arrow ’ of a sarcasm launched
by a person just retiring and to which it is therefore impossible to reply.
‚122 quae nihil attinent, ‘ things of no concern ἐ the lover has weightier
matters than wars and politics to think about.

13. vivum caespitem. Fresh—cut‚ ‘ living turf‚’ to form an impromptu
altar, cf. 3. 8. 4. 14. verbenas. A technical word of uncertain deriva-
tion, applied to all boughs or green things used in religious rites ; cf. Servius
on Virg. Aen. 12. 120 verbenas vocamus omues frondes sacratas, ut est laurus,
oliva, vel myrtus. 16. mactata, ‘ she will come with lessened violence
when we have sacrificed a victim.' macto (from root may: cf. magia, maior
:mayion μακρός) means (1) to increase or magnffy, hence mactare deos extis,
to honour the gods with entrails, (2) to sacrifice, as here, the word having
become confined to the religious meaning of honouring by sacrifice.

ODE XX

An invitation to Maecenas to come and see him at his Sabine farm. The
wine he can offer will be poor, but had been specially bottled by himself in
honour of an interesting event in Maecenas' life.

1. potabis, ‘ you will drink if you accept my invitation ' =1 shall be glad
if you wffl come and drink. For the fut. cf. 1. 7 Int.; Ep. 1. 4. 15 n.
Sabinum: wine grown in the immediate neighbourhood, which was not
celebrated for wine. 2. Graeca testa. For use of Greek wines cf. 1.
17. 21. Τ110 J‘ar would retain some of the aroma of the nobler vintage (cf.
Ep. 1. 2. 69) and impart it to the Sabine wine. Cf. the practice of keeping
whisky in old sherry casks. ipse marks the care he had bestowed. 3.
conditum levi, ‘stored up and smeared ’ (with pitch). Of. 3. 8. 9 11. Pitch
was used to secure the cork from mfldew, etc„ as we use wax. 4. plausus.
He was cheered on entering the theatre after an illness3 cf. 2. 17. 25.

5. eques. There is special force in this reference to the fact that
Maecenas remained contented with the comparatively humble position of an
eques (see 3. 16. 20 n.)‚ when the poet is inviting him to his own humble roof.
Bentley's suggestion of clare for aare spoils the whole friendliness and pleasant-
