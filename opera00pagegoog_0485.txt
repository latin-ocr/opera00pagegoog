sumn 111 NOTES 457

compita: at the compita were images of the Lares compitales (qui compita
serwnt Ov. Fast. 2. 615). siccus, not drunk, though one might think
he was; opp. invidit& cf. Od. 4. 5. 39. 282. lautis: Hom. 11. 6. 266
χερσὶ δ’ ἀνίπτοισιν Διὶ λείβειν αἴθοπα οἶνον Ι ἅζομαιε Hes. O. et D. 724.
283. quid tam magnum, ‘ what is there in my request so great or difficult '
(that I may not pray for it to be granted by you 2) surpiter-surm'pite .-
cf. acpite in Ennius, Cic. de Off. 1. 12. 383 poryite Virg. Aen. 8. 274. 284.
dis facile: cf. Theognis 11 σοὶ μὲν τοῦτο, θεά, μικρόν, ἐμοὶ δὲ μέγα. 285.
nisi litigiosus, ‘unless he were fond of law-suits,' as a law-suit would be
sure to follow for fraudulent sale, cf. Ep. 2. 2. 16 11.; Cic. de Off. 3. 17. 71
in mancipiorum venditione venditoris smus omnis eaecluditur. qui enim
scire debuit de sanitate-cle fuya de furtis praestat edicto aedilium ; Varro, R. R.
2. 10. 5 in (servorum) emptione solet stipulatio intercedere sanum eum esse, furtis
noxisque solutum. 287. Chrysippus: 1. 3. 126. Meneni: some lunatio.

289. cubantis: cf. 1. 9. 18. 290. qumana: sc. febri-9, the quartan
agne, recurring every fourth day. 291. die . . . ieiunia: Porph. says dies
lovis, i. e. Thursday. The oriental division of time into weeks, and the names
of the days of the weeks derived from the sun, moon, and five planets, though
not adopted by the Romans until the time of Theodosius (end of 4th cent.)‚
must have been known to them much earlier: cf. Tibull. 1. 3. 18 Satur-ni-
(lie-m, i. e. Saturday. Kiessling considers that there is a reference to the fact
that Thursday is one of the two days on which the Pharisees fasted (ef. Comm.
011 Luke xviii. 12). Orelli⁴¹ also refers the phrase to Jewish beliefs (leyem
Iudaeorum pulsat Acron) but explains of the actual Sabbath which the Jews
were supposed to keep as a fast. The immersion of the boy 111 a stream by
way of purification seems certainly to point to some oriental belief being hinted
at. 292. casus medicusve: note the satire. levarit, ie. si levarit,
1. 4. 18. 293. ex praecipiti, ‘from his peril ' ε in praecipiti is a
technical term used of the critical state of a sick person, Cels. 2. 6. 295.
quone : ef. 2. 2. 107 11. timore deorum ε the moral is that of LucretiuS‚
1. 101 tantum reliyio potuit suadere malorum.

296. sapientum octavae, ‘the eighth of the wise men‚' with a reference
to the ‘seven wise men' of Greece. So Sappho is called ‘the tenth muse.'
297. compellarer, absolutely ‘called names‚' meaning the particular name
of insanus, as we see from the next line: compellare often means to assai]
with bad names; ef. Ep. 1. 7. 34; Cic. Phil. 3. 7. 17 Ciceronem compellat
edicto nec sentit amens commendationem esse compellationem suam. inultus,
‘ with impunity.' 298. totidem audiet, ‘ shall hear as much in his turn!
totidem, sc. verba. audiet is not, perhaPS, here quite: ‘ to be called‚’ as 2.
6. 20 ; Ep. 1. 7. 38 ; 1. 16. 17, but is like Plaut. Pseud. 4. 7. 77 contumeliam
si dicis audies, 299. respicere ignoto discet pendentia. tergo, ‘shall
be told to look at what hange from the back which he cannot survey.' The
reference is to the well-known fable of the two wallets; ef. Phaedr. 4. 10
vera-3 imposuit Iuppiter nobis dua-3 : Ι propriis repletam vitiis post teo-qum
dedit .· Ι alicnis ante pectus sufflendit 9mvem; Pers. 4. 23; Catull. 22. 21.
300. Stoice . . .: Horace is the speaker. sic, ‘so may you sel] . . .
with what folly am I mad ?'=‘so may you sell . . . tell me with what . . . ’ζ’
For sic in appeaIS‚ cf. Od. 1. 3. 1 n. pluris, ‘at a profit.' Horace sup·
poses Damasippus to be passing through the bankruptcy court ; and he wishes
that his assets (his statues, bric-a-brae‚ ete.), may realise more than twenty
shillings in the pounch so as to pay his creditors, and leave him a balance.
