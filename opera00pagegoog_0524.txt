been the first to expound the writings of Plato, and Cicero warmly praises his
work on Sorrow (περὶ πένθους); 110 assisted Polemo, the fourth head of the
Academy, and in Academia vel imprimis suit nobilis (Cic. Tusc. 3. 6. 12).

the corrupt destinet found in some MSS.

Servius ad loc. πᾶς μὴ ’Ἐλλην βάρβαροςε Ennius in Cic. Tusc. 1. 35. 85
adstante ope barbarica. The Phrygian language was closely related to Greek,
but probably not more closely than Latin, a connexion which did not prevent
the Greeks from speaking of the Romans as barbari (cf. Plaut. Asin. prol. 10),
and Italy as barbaria (Poen. 3. 2. 21). Homer in the Iliad nowhere represents
the Trojans as unintelligible to the Greeks, and uses βαρβαρόφωνοι only of the
Carians (2. 867). duello, the earlier form of bellum, which is derived from
it, as bis from duis, eto. Horace uses this form in 2. 1. 254 ; 2. 2. 98 ; Od.
3. 5. 38; 3. 14. 18; 4. 15. 8. Here he employs the word to give a heroic
tone to his verse, cf. Od. 1. 34. 5 11. 8. aestus, ‘ fiery passions,' not, perhaps,
with any reference to the tide, but rather to the primary meaning of the word
(root iah ‘burn,' as in aestas, αἴθω, eto.)

censeo contains the idea ‘ advise‚' ‘recommend.' 10. quid Paris ‘2‘ just like

Cicero's practice with interesse, eg. de Pin. 1. 9. 30, de Am. 25. 95. Livy
10. 7 has the repetition with certatum. Peliden: the termination -en in
the 300. of patronymics is everywhere much better established than the form
in -em, and is often necessary to the metre, as in S. 1. 7. 11 ; Roby 473, S.
G. 150. In feminine names Horace uses the Greek form in the Odes‚ the
Latin in the Satires and Epistles, except perhaps S. 2. 5. 81. · 13. hunc,
Agamemnon, not Achilles. The ‘love' of Achilles is not noticed in the first
book of the Iliad, to which Horace is here referring, but in 9. 342 ὡς καὶ ε”γὼ

sites Il. 2. 115 seq. dolis: Pandarus.‚ Il. 4. 134 seq. scelere perhaps
especially referring to Paris, libidine including the passion of Paris for Helen,
and also the tyrannous caprice of Agamemnon.
