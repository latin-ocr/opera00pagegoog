25. multa . . . ‘strong is the breeze that lifts . . .' Dirce was a
fountain near Thebes, and the epithet is inore poetica] than ‘Theban '
because swans in fact and the Muses in fiction love fountainS. For
the swan’s song see 2. 20. 15 11. 27. Matinae: Mons Matinus is in
Apulia. For apis cf. Ep. 1. 3. 21 n. 28. more modoque: merely an
alliterative phrase: ‘ after the manner and method of ἐ so Cicero, Tim. 1,
has Carneadeo more et modo disputata. Some take mos of natural,
modus of customary habits, but the distinction is dubious. 29. carpentis,
came, ‘to pluck‚' ‘graze on,' e.g. camere herbam, used of animals, here:
‘to seed on,’ per laborem ε adverbially,= ‘laboriously‚’ cf. per vim, per
iram, per iocum, etc. Many join per laborem plurimum but the phrase seems
very prosaic, and the pause after plurimum violates the natural movement of
the verse. Bentley, Nauck, and Orelli⁴ j0in plurim-um nemus, but translate
plurimum ‘ deusest,' 'which is at once unjustifiable and meaningless. It is
best to take plurimum nemu-3, as the ear suggests, together, and to give
plurimum its common sense of ‘ very many,' translating, ‘like a bee labori-
ously culling its sweets from thyme around full many a grove and . . . '
30. uvidi. So called because of the falls of the Anio there, cf. 1. 7. 13 n., but
also in opposition to the altos nubium tractus where Pindar soars. 31. ope-
rosa . . . ε notice the perfectiori of the comparison ε the tiny bee laboriously
fashions its honey-cell ; the humble poet frames his verse with equal toil.

33. concines, ‘you (Antonius just mentioned in line 26), a poet of
nobler touch, shall celebrate Caesar when . . .' maiore plectro (cf. 2. 1.
40 n.) is purposely placed so that it can go either with concines or poeta.
35. per sacrum clivum. The Via Sacra was the principal street in Rome
(S. 1. 9. 1): it ran from between the Caelian and Esquiline hills, along the
N. slope of the Palatine, under the Arch of Titus, past the Forum Romanum,
up to the Capitol. The term sacer clivus (only found here and Mart. 1. 71.
5) seems to be applied to the part of it which slopes downwards (cf. Epod. 7.
7 Britannus ut descenderet Sacra catenatus via) from the Arch of Titus to
the Forum. Along the Via Sacra all triumpha] processions passed. 36.
Sygambros: this German tribe inhabited a district on the river Sieg, near
Bonn τ with other tribes they had inflicted a serious defeat on M. Lollius, B.c.
16. Augustus proceeded to Gaul in that year and they immediately made
peace, but his stay continued to July B.c. 13.

37. nihil . . . ‘naught greater or more gloriouS.’ 38. boni: emphatic,
‘ in their goodneSS.' 39. quamvis . . . ‘though the ages run backward to
their ancient gold‚’ i.e. though the golden age should return. 40. pris-
cum: 3. 21. 11 n. 42. super . . . ‘in honour of the return of brave
Augustus vouchsafed (to our prayers).' Coins are extant with the inscription
s.P.Q.R.V.S. (vota suscepta) PRO S. (salute) ΕΤ RED. AUG. 43. forum-
que: governed by concines. The law-courts were in the Forum and were
closed on occasions of public rejoicing ; cf. Ov. Fasti 4. 187 scena sonat, ludi-
que vocant. spectate, Quirites, Ι et fora Marte suo litigiosa vacent.

45. tum meae . . . ‘then too Ι , so but I speak aught worth hearing,
shall join in with the best portion of my utterance.' meae: emphatic by
position ε you shall take the chief part, and then even I shall venture to join
in. 49. tuque dum procedis . . . ‘and while thou dost take,the lead,
“Hc Triumph !” yea not once only will we cry “Ho Tn'umph l '' even all
the citizens, and offer incense to the bounteous gods.' The objections to this
rendering are two ε (1) tuque is a conjecture, (2) 11 is urged that dum procedis
