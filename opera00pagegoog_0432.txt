may be a complaint of the same slave to the skipper for allowing his boat to
be overcrowded‚ or with Orelli we may take it and ohe iam satis est as ex-
clamations of other pueri. trecentos, of a large number like ducenti,
sexcenti. Of this canal Strabo gives the following account (233): πλησίον δὲ
τῆς Ταρρακίνης (he 13 taking the route towards Rome) βαδίζοντι ἐπὶ τῆς Ρώμης
παραβέβληται (runs parallel) τῇ ὀδῷ τῇ Ἀππίᾳ διῶρυξ ἐπὶ πολλοὺς τόπους
πληρουμένη τοῖς ἑλείοις τε καὶ τοῖς ποταμίοις ὕδασι· πλεῖται δὲ μάλιστα μὲν
νύκτωρ ὥστ’ ἐμβάντας ἀφ’ ἑσπέρας ἐκβαίνειν πρωίας καὶ βαδίζειν τὸ λοιπὸν τῇ
ὁδῷ, ἀλλὰ καὶ μεθ’ ἡμέραν· ῥυμουλκειται δὲ δι’ ἡμιόνων. Τ116 canal- boat was
used at night, because passengcrs slept on board, and so saved time: hence
most people tried to reach Forum Appi 1n one day so as to take the boat at
night. 13. aee, the fare (ναῦλος, ναῦλον).

15. ut, ‘while,' joined by Bentley to the preceding words as in the text.
This is an unusual sense of ut, and in the two passages referred to by Bentley
in support of it ut forte is the phrase (Ter. Ad. 3. 3. 53; Plaut. Men. prol.
63). The passage is still more difficult, however, if ut is joined to what
follows, and ut may be spurious. It is omitted in some MSS„ and without
it the asyndeton avertunt, cantat, incipit is graphio and vigorous. 16.
prolutus, ‘ soaked ' 3 cf. Virg. Aen. 1. 739: so madidus, uviduS, inriynus
are used, cf. 2. 1. 9. vappa: 1. 1. 104 n. The sailor who had charge of
the boat kept up a singing match with a passenger, as drunk as himself, until
the latter went to sleep; then 116 coolly went to sleep himself, having first
tethered the mule that drew the boat. 19. religare, ‘to moor to ' 3 cf.
Od. 1. 32. 7. 20. 1111 procedere, ‘was making no way.’ 21. cere-
brosus unus, ‘ a choleric party.' The unfortunate passengers woke up at
dawn to find themselves stock-still, and the mule tethered. This was more
than a cerebrosus could stand ; cf. 1. 9. 11 o te, Bolane, cerebri Ι felicem: accord-
ingly he administers a sound drubbing (dolat) with a willow cudgel to the
sleeping conductor.

23. quarta: somewhere about 10 o ’clock. There is some uncertainty,
when these numbers are used, whether the beginning or the end of the hour
13 meant: see Becker' 3 Gallus p. 317. But when the hour is mentioned
absolutely without any word which denotes its beginning or progress, the
completed hour is probably intended. There must, however, have been con-
siderable vagueness in such expressions, owing to the length of the hour
varying with the seasons, and the want of accurate clocks. exponimur ε
to land, opp. to inponere, to embark. 24. lavimus, of dipping the
hands in the spring and laving the face, is much better than the neutral
lavimur of Bentley, which would rather suit the notion of a bath. This
would be a profanation: the laving the hands and face would be a religious

Ι ceremony and mark of respect. Feronia: an ancient <Italian goddeSS,

consort of Jupiter Anxurus; Virg. Aen. 7. 799 quis Iuppiter Anaeurzhs arvis 1
praesidet, et, viridi qaudens Feronia luco, 25. repimus, we crawl’ :for
Anxur, the old Volscian name of Tarracina, was on a mountain, with white
limestone cliffs (candidus Anxur Mart. 5.1. 6). It was twenty miles from
Forum Appi. Here the Appian Way first touches the sea-coast. 28.
Cocceius: M. Cocceius Nerva, great-grandfather of the emperor Nerva.
29. aversos . . . See Intr. at end.

30. collyria : perhaps derived from κολλύρα, a roll of bread 3 ‘eye-salve,'
probably a sort of doughy paste. 31. inlinere. Horace is fond of the
historical or narrative infinitive: cf. 1. 9. 10, where it has the first person, as ”
