world subdued, etc.,’ i.e. Ι seem in imagination already to be listening to the
recitation of your history of these events. Nowadays we should expect
‘already Ι seem to be reading] your description . . . ‚⁹ but before the inven-
tion of printing public recitation was one of the best met-hods of making
known a new work (cf. the story of Thucydides hearing Herodotus recite
his history at Olympia) and Pollio himself introduced the practice at Rome

Contr. 4. Orelli takes audire in two 8011808, ‘ I seem to hear great generals
(i.e. harangm'ng their troops, etc.) and of a world subdued‚’ but this double
use of audire in two distinct 8011808 18 impossible. Kiessling takes audire
‘hear' in both cases and compares cancta &abacta with line 32 Hespe-fiae soni-
tum rainae, but cuncta subacta suggests no idea of anything actually audible.
22. sordidos is medicativa, and thus strictly parallel to subacta. 23. cuncta
terrarum, ‘all things in the world '—a variety of the possessive gen. (not
to be confounded with our ‘all 0f‚' or ‘the whole of '), cf. 4. 12. 19 amara
curarum ; Tac. Hist. 5. 10 cuncta campomm. 24. atrocem animum

, 25. Iuno . . . The transition is natural and easy from the death of Cato
to the thought how amply Oarthage and Jugurtha had been avenged for all
they had suffered at the hands of Rome by the sight of Roman carnage. J uno
was the tutelary deity of Carthage‚ cf. Virg. Aen. 1. 15 seq. The nom. to
rettulit is Iano and deorum quisquis . . . cesserat inpotens tellure, while
inferias is in apposition to nepotes, ‘have brought the grandchildren of the
victors to J ugurtha as an offering at his tomb.' For sing. verb after two
subjects cf. 2. 13. 38 n. 26. cesserat. The gods were supposed to quit
doomed cities, cf. Virg. Aen. 2. 351 excessere omnes adytis arisque relictis Ι di,
and the account of Josephus (B. J. 6. 5. 3) that before the capture of Jerusalem
the gates of the Temple burst open, and a voice more than human was heard
exclaiming ‘Let us go hence ' (μεταβαίνωμεν ἐντεῦθεν). Carthage was sacked
by P. Scipio Africanus Minor B.c. 146. inpotens: in its simple meaning
‘ powerless‚' ele. to save. 28. Iugurthae: emphatic by position. Horace
could not better illustrate the ‘mockery of fortune' than by describing the
Romans who fell at Thapsus as sacrificed to the ghost of J ugurtha 1 Δ

Persae 806, where the Persians who fell at Plataea are spoken of as φίλον
πίασμα Βοιωτῶν χθονί, and Virg. G. 1. 491 bis sanquine nostro Ι Emathiam
et latos Haemi pinquescere campos, 30. sepulchris: with testatur, ‘bears
witness by its tombs. ' inpia: pius expresses the regard due by a child
to a parent (cf. pius Aeneas), then that due from one relative to another, from

one citizen to another. Hence civil wars were strictly inpia, ‘unhallowed‚' a
violation of the law of nature. 31. Medis, i. e. Parthians (cf. 1. 2. 22 and

51 n.)‚ who would naturally rejoice to hear ‘the din of the downfall of ’

Italy.' 32. Hesperiae‚‘Weste1-n‚' i.e. Italian, in contrast with the Eastern
empire of the Parthians Just referred to. So too 3. 6. 8 where the Parthians
are mentioned in the next line, and 4. 5. 38 where it is contrasted with
Graecia line 35. On the other hand 1. 36. 4 Ηεῳετίαε Spain, Numida being
described as returm'ng to Rome from‘ the farthest West’ In each case the
meaning is clear from the context.
