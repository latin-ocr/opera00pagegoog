230 HORACE Book 1

et extra Ι processit louqe flammantia moenia muudi Ι atque omue inmensum
perayravit mente animoque . . . 6. morituro. Notice the force this
derives from its position, cf. moriture 2. 3. 4. 7-9. Pelopis genitor,
TithonUS, Minos. See class. Dict. and Tennyson’s poem Tithonus.

10. Panthoiden. See class. Dict. under ‘Pythagoras' Even he, not-
withstanding his theory of μετεμψύχωσις or the transmigration of souis, and
the fact that he had enJ'oyed several lives, first as a peacock, then as Euphor-
bus (=Panthoides) at Troy, then as Homer, then as Pythagorae, and finally
as Q. Ennius (cf. Persius 6. 10), has finally been compelled to succumb to the
great law of mortality. There is something sarcastic in Horace’s style here,
and some regard the whole Ode as a scoff at the theories of Pythagoras.
orcozin Orcum, cf. caelo 3. 23. 1 n. 11. clipeo refixo. Pythagoras
proved the identity of his soul with that of Euphorbus, by at once ‘taking
down ' the shield of Euphorbus from a quantity of other armour.

13. nervos atque cutem. Contemptuous words to express the mere
mortal envelope of the more lasting and transmigrating soul. 14. iudice
te. Because Archytas was a disciple of Pythagoras, non sordidus, i.e.
‘most distinguished‚’ cf. St. Paul's ‘no mean city,' Acts xxi. 39. LitoteS.
16. semel, ‘once,' and once for all. 17. spectacula. To Mars war is
an amusement (cf. 1. 2. 37 louyo satiate ludo) and slaughter a spectaculum.
20. caput. Cf. Virg. Aen. 4. 698 necdum illi flavum Proserpina vertice
crinem Ι abstulerat, Styyioque caput damnaverat OrcO. Therefore caput does
not merely: ‘man,' ‘life,’ but refers to the legend that Proserpine marks out
the victims of Death by symbolically cutting a lock from their heads, as was
done with sacrificial victims. ffigit: the aoristic use of the perfect, ‘is not
wont to avoid any head‚' cf. 1. 34. 16 sustulit.

21. me quoque. These words from their emphatic position are clearly
guiding words, and it is most natural to contrast them with te in line 1 : ‘ You,
Archytas, are dead . . . . and Ι 100.’ devexi Orionis: the setting of
Orion early 111 November was accompanied by storms, cf. 3. 27. 18 pronus
Ortou. rapidus: from rapio, ⁴ sweeping,' ‘raving.' 23. malignus,
‘ grudging ' ι 1110 opposite of beuiynus, liberal. 24. capiti inhumato. The
hiatus, especially where the vowels are the same, is extremely harsh. It is
perhaps an affectation of simplicity like stant et iuniperi et castaneae hirsutae,
Virg. Ecl. 7. 53. Instances of hiatus with proper names, such as Threicio
Aquilone Epod. 13. 3 3 Actaeo Aracyntho Virg. Ecl. 2. 24, are quite distinct,
being an imitation of Greek models‚ see 2. 20. 13 11. 25. particulam
harenae. The three handfuls of earth, which constituted legitimate burial and
saved the dead soul from wandering on the shores of Styx, cf. Virg. Aen. 6. 325.

25. sic: see 1. 3. l; ‘so’zon condition that you do this, may . . .
27. plectantur, ‘be lashed,' i.e. by storms. Cf. Gk. πλήσσω. 28. 1111ᾱο
:a quo, i.e. from Jove. 30. neclegis . . . te natis . . . committere.
te goes with committere and not with uatis .· ‘ Dost thou deem it a light thing
that thou art incurring . . . ’ζ’ uecleqis committere? without te would mean
‘ Dost thou neglect incurring 2 ’ which is the exact opposite of what is wanted.
31. fraudem: ἄγος, a deed which pollutos, and must be expiated. 32.
debita iura. The debt to J'ustice which you will incur and have to discharge.
33. te ipsum: contrasted with uatis. The penalty may come not only on
them, but on yourself even. 36. ter pulvere. Cf. Soph. Ant. 431
χοαῖσι τρισπόνδοισι τὸν νέκυν στέφει.
