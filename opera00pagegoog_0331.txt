ODE XIV

‘ Caesar, whom but now we spoke os as enqayed in a ‚qim-ioue but hazardous
campaign, is returniny from Spain in triumph. Lei his wife 90 forth ἀπίῃ to
meet him and his sister, and Zet all the wives and mothers of Rome accompany
them. Meanwhile I will employ the peace and security Caesar has won for us
by having a small festival os my own. Qaick, slave, bring] ammenta flowers
and the oldest wine. Go too invite Neaera, but if the porter 'makes much ado
about letiiny you in, —come baele: I am yettiny old and not inclined to put

The Ode has been severely criticised, and certainly not only are the three
first stanzas commonplace, but the contrast between their formal and official
frigidity and the licentious vigour of the rest of the Ode is very harsh. For
the war with Spain see 2. 6. 2 n.

1. Herculis. Hercules is one of Horace's stock types of virtue ultimately
deified (cf. 3. 3. 9), but he was also specially connected with Spain as having
brought away the oxen of Geryon, and the worship of him as Hercules Victor
(cf. victor) at the Ara Maxima was popular with the lower orders, cf. o
plebs. Moreover in Β. c. 24 plebs Romana had received from the emperor
a donative of 400 sesterces apiece ; Mon. Anc. 3. 10. 2. morte, ‘to have
sought the laurels death alone can buy.’ He had been seriously ill at Tarraco
and rumours (cf. dictus) of his death had probably reached Rome.

5. unico . . . ‘let the wife whose pride is in her illustrious consort
advance, having sacrificed with due riteS.' mulier = Livia. Orelli
explains unico 9. m. as :proprio qaudens marito adding that ‘ this virtue was
then rare.' But no poet could congratulate an empress on not being immoral,
and unicus maritus should mean ‘ a single husband,’ like unicus filius, ete.
On the other hand the derived use of unicusz‘eminent ' is common with
dum, imperator, etc. 6. iustis operata sacris: operari is used not
only in a general sense: ‘to perform,’ but in a special sense ‘ to perform
what is due to the gods,’ i.e. to εαοτὶἣοθερέζειν. For sacris many MSS.
give divis. ’7. soror. Octavia, the widow of Antony. The original name
of Augustus was O. OctaviuS, then, aster his adoption by Julius Caesar, C.
Julius Caesar Octavianus. 8. supplice vitta. The vitta (see Dict. Ant.)
was ordinarily worn by freeborn maids and matrons. Here however the
reference is to a special vitta of wool worn during religious rites, and the word
in connexion with supplice suggests a supplicatio or ⁴ public thanksgiving!

9. nuper sospitum. These words supply the reason for the mothers’
thanksgiving. 10. et puellae . . . ‘and young girls who have but
lately had knowledge of wedlock‚ rest-ain from ill-omened words.' For male
ominati-3 parcite verbis cf. 3. 1. 2 n. Τ11θ hiatus between male and ominatis
is very striking, but cf. the equally remarkable 3. 11. 50 secundo Ι omine and
Pers, 3. 66 discite ο miseri. Many MSS. have male nmninatis ‘ill- named
words' which is meaningless, though some defend it as: δυσῳνύμοις. male
inominatis‘ very ill· omened’ (male intensive, cf. 1. 17. 25 n.) ls a conjecture,
but is too ugly. puellae can be used of married women e. 9. 3. 22. 2, but
