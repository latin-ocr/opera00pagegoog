The Epode is addressed to an arrogant and upstart freedman, whom the
scholiasts call Menas or Menodorus, a freedman of Sex. Pompeius and a com-
mander of his fieet, who deserted to Octavian in B.o. 38. It is safer to assume
that we have merely a type of those wealthy freedmen who from the time of
Sulla begin to figure so prominently in Roman society.
