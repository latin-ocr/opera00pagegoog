550 HORACE 110οΚ 1

have maintained my own oriyinality, in spite (ff my debt to them. 21. per
vacuum, ‘ on ground unclaimed by others,’ a legal term. Gaius 2. 51. 22.
pressi: Lucr. 3. 3 inque tuis nunc Ι fiaea pedum pono pressis vestim-'a siquis.
23. reget examen: imitatus reqem apium se sequentium ducem—Porph.
Parios: Archilochus was born at ParOS, but lived a roving life. Though
not strictly speaking the inventor of the iambic metre (Mahaffy‚ Greek
Literature 1. 157) he was the first to use it largely in literature. But he also
employed the elegiae verse, introduced shortly before his time by Callinus.
primus t Catullus had previously employed iambic trimeters.(to say nothing
of the dramatic poets) 3 but Horace in his Epodes had been the first to imitate
the more complex Ἐπῳδοί. 24. animos, ‘spirit' 25. agentia, ‘which
pursued ' : ayitare is more usual 111 this sense. When Lycambes of Paros re-
fused to give his youngest daughter Neobule to Archilochus, as he had promised
to do, the latter assailed him with such bitter verses that he hanged himself.

26. brevioribus, ‘humbler‚' ⁶ scantier‚' rather than ‘less enduring’ (for
which cf. Od. 1. 36. 16). Horace is arguing in defence of his own originality.
It is true, he says, that Ι imitated the metres of Archilochus : but so did Sappho
and Alcaeus, and no one accuses them of plagiarism‚ for their themes and
style are altogether different: and so are mine. 27. artem, ‘technique.'
28. temperat . . . Sappho, ‘masculine Sappho moulds her Muse by the
measure of Archilochus ': temperare is the regular word for giving artistic
shape to a composition, especially of music: Od. 4. 3. 183 Prop. 2. 34
( =3. 26) 79 tale facis carmen docta testudine quale} Cynthius inpositis
temperat articulis. pede is not ‘ foot ' but ‘ measure,' denoting the whole
line, as in Od. 4. 6. 35; A. P. 81. 29. ordine: best understood with
Bentley of the arrangement of the various lines used by 'Archilochus in a
strophe: aq. the Archilochus minor (-υυ-υυ-) was coupled by Alcaeus
with a dactylic hexameter (cf. Od. 4. 7), by Archilochus himself with an
iambic trimeter (Frag. 104). 30. neo . . . In reality Alcaeus seems
to have attacked Pittacus with no less bitterness than Archilochus shewed
to LycambeS‚ though on political as much as on personal grounds. atris:
cf. Epod. 6. 15 atro dente: so niger in S. 1. 4. 85. 31. famoso, ‘libellous,'
cf. S. 2. 1. 68 ; Suet. CaeS. 73 famosa epiyrammata; Tac. Ann. 1. 72 faniosi
libelli. The earliest instance in which the word has a neutral meaning, if not
a positively good one, is in A. P. 469 ‘much talked of.’ Even in Tacitus it has
hardly acquired the meaning of ‘renowned'z cf. Hist. 3. 38.

32. hunc: unquestionably Alcaeus. Archilochus was not included among
the lyric poets, strictly speaking. Catullus and perhaps Calvus had already
used the Sapphic metre ; but 110 0116 as yet the metre of Alcaeus, Cp. Od. 3.
30. 13 princeps Aeolium carmen acl Italos Ι ἀαίτιαείεεε modos. 34. ingenuis,
.‘ gentle,' contrasted with the ventosa plebs of line 37. The audience for whom
Horace wrote was one of ‘gentlemen‚’ such as those named S. 1. 10. 81-90.
Conington happily renders ‘ Well may the bard feel proud, whose pen supplies

Ι Unhackneyed strains to gentle hands and eyeS.²

35-41. I am disparayed in public thouyh lihed in private, because I take no
unworthy steps to secure applause. 35. opuscula: cf. 1. 4. 3 n. 36.
premat, ‘disparages,’ A. P. 2623 Virg. Aen. 11. 401 extollere vires Ι yentis
bis victae, contra premere arma Latini ,· Quintil. 12. 10. 14 praecipue pres-
serunt eum (M. Tullium), qui videri Atticorum imitatores cupiebant, and so often
in Tacitus. 37. ventosae : 1. 8. 12 11. plebis: all who could be gathered
to listen to a recitation. For recitations at Rome see Mayor on Juv. 3. 9.
