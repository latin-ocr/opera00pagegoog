INTRODUGTION xiii

song is in strict accordance with Horace's characteristic dislike to
end on a high-pitched note. The first ten Odes of the second
Book are alternately Alcaics and SapphicS‚ while the stately
Roman-Odes ‚which commence the third Book are, with their
noble exordium, manifestly where they were designed to be.

Lastly the concluding Ode of the third Book

Exeqi monimentum aere perennius

clearly presupposes a complete and final collection of the Odes to
which it is appended.

The date of the production of these three Books is generally
considered to lie between 30 13.c.‚ the date of the Cleopatra-Ode,1
and 23 B.c., the date of the death of Marcellus, who in 1. 12. 46
is spoken of as alive: but though the latter date may be considered
fairly certain, it is impossible to say whether some Odes may not
have been written—or partly written—considerably before 30 B.c.

The fourth Book was published about 13 B.C.‚ being separated
from the other three by a considerable interval, as is shown by
internal evidence 2 and definitely stated by Suetonius—Sempla eius
usque adeo probavit (Auyustus) mansuraque perpetuo opinatus est
ut non modo saeculare carmen componendum iniunxem't, sed et
Vindelicam victoriam Tiberii Drusique priviynorum suorum,
eumque coeyerit propter Ιιοσ tribus carminum libris ea· lonyo
intervallo quartum addere. .

The Carmen Saeculare is a Sapphic Ode written to be sung>
publicly by a chorus of youths and maidens in the great ‘ Secular
Games' exhibited by Augustus 17 B.0.3

All Latin poetry (except Satire) is copied from Greek modeIS.
Terence copies Menander, Propertius Callimachus, Lucretius
Empedocles, Virgil Hesiod and Homer: so Horace in the Odes
copies the Greek lyric writers. The sportive lays of Anacreon,
occasionally the dirges of SimonideS, but above all the passionate
love-songs of Sappho and the patriotic odes of Alcaeus are the
models which he follows,4 Sometimes he copies his model very
closely, especially at the beginning of an Ode (ey. in Odes 9, 14
37 of Book I), but as a whole it may be said that the form and
outline of his Odes are copied rather than the details.

1 The latest reference in the Epodes is to the battle of Actium.

² See Intr. to Book IV.

3 The full description of these games is given in an inscription, discovered
in 1890, printed in Lanciani's Payan and Chaistian Rome.

4 Pindar he makes no attempt to copy, for he knew that the ‘Theban

eagle ' soared on pinions stronger than his own.
