cf. 1. 1. 8 11. The word is used strictly : the Roman emperors carefully
retained the old forms of the Republic : the old magistracies were still allowed
to exist in name (eadem maqistratuum vocabula, Tac. Ann. 1. 3). Τ116 emperor
was technically only an ordinary citizen, on whom the senate and people had
from time to time conferred various ordinary and extraordinary dignities.
Thus Augustus was appointed perpetual Imperator, 13.c. 29, and in the same
year accepted the ‘ censorian power ’ ; in B.0. 28 116 became princeps senatus ,-
he was consul for the 6th time Β.ο. 28, and for the 7th time B.c. 27 ; in B.c.
23 he received the ‘tribunician power,' and in B.c. 12 he was made pontifex
mximas .· see Merivale c. 31. 3. Auguste. Octavian assumed this
name B.c. 27 3 it really served as a title ε ‘ the name was intact,’ says Merivale‚
‘it had never been borne by any man before‚’ but the adjective was applied to
things holy and divine and suggested power and greatness (cf. auyeo, and see
Ov. Fast. 1. 609). in aevum . . . aeternet: pleonastic emphasis: ‘is

titulos . . . ‘by (means of) inscriptions and recording annaIS.' Fasti sunt
fasti dics, says Festus : fastus is originally an adj. from sari, and fasti (dics)
are (1) days ‘on which the magistrates may speak,' on which the law-courts
are open, cf. ovid, Fast. l. 47, (2) a register or list of such days, (3) as here,
‘ annaIS,’ ‘ records.’ Such public records would be the annales maximi kept
by the pontvffex maximus.

principum. The title of princeps senatus was a purely honorary distinction
conferred by the censors on the most esteemed and worthy of the senators. It
was the title which Augustus specially affected : cf. Tac. Ann. 1. 1 cuncta . . .
nomine principis sub imperium accepit ; 1. 2. 50. The word certainly does not
in Horace's time mean ‘ a prince ' or ⁴ sovereign,' and so mminw principum
must be taken=maxinae princeps ¹7. quem . . . Vindelici didicere . . .
quid Marte posses : lit. ‘ whom the V. have learnt what thou couldst 111
war,' i.e. whose prowess in war the V. have learnt. This idiom by which
the nom. of the subordinate sentence is placed under the government of the
main verb is Gk. rather than Latin, ay. οἶδά, σε τίς εἰ.

10. Genaunos. These and the Brenni, whose name still sur-vives in the
Brenner pass, are two tribes of the Raeti in the modern Tyrol. 11. et
arces . . . ‘and citadels that crown the awful Alps? arx, derived ‘ab
arcendo,’ = ‘ a place of defence’ situated on an eminence. 13. deiecit,
‘o’erthrew ’: the word governs all the accusatives which precede, though,
perhaps, more strictly applicable to the last. plus vice simplici: lit.
‘more than with one-sold requitaL' i.c. avenging every loss he suffered by
inflicting a much greater. The omission of quam after plus is not uncommon,
e.g. plns quinyentos colaphos infreyit mihi, Ter. Ad. 2. 1. 46. Conington
renders ‘ and paid them back their debt twice told.' 15. inmanes : 3. 4.
