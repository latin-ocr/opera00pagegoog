in time of war, and is not to be made too general.

metato ε after the battle of Philippi the veterans of Octavian were allotted
lands in different parts of Italy. The former owners were dispossessed without
compensation. Virgil thus lost his property, and thus Propertius lost his.
A survey of the lands to be assigned was necessary ; ‘metari is regularly used
of this survey ; pertica or decempeda was the pole, or measuring rod, used by
the metatores ; so Propertius, lamenting his losses, sayS, 4. 1. 130 abstulit
excultas pertica tristis opes, Hence metato, ‘surveyed‚' comes to have the
meaning of ‘ forfeited ' here. For metatus, passive, from metor, cf. Od. 1. 1. 25 n.
115. fortem mercede colonum, ‘a hardy tiller of the soil for hire! Um-
brenus, the veteran, seems to hare been a sensible man, and to have recognised
the fact that 116 would get more out of the farm by leaving an honest farmer
like Ofellus to work it, than by taking it on his own hands. He, therefore,
left him and his family on the farm, paying him so much for working it.

116. non temere, ‘ not lightly,' οὐ ῥαδίως : not without a cause. pro·

. . mensas ε second course=our dessert ; called mensae, because the tables
were removed, to be cleared and reloaded. Several small tables were often used ;
hence the plural. duplice ficu : the fig slit up for drying, and so doubled.

123. post hoc . . . magistra, ‘afterwards we had a game at drinking
under the presidency of a forfeit.’ Cf. Plaut. Stich. 5. 4. 43 amdam, Stiche .-
uter demutas-sit poculo multabitur . . . si peccassis multam hic retinebo illico.
culpa is aviolation of the laws of the drinking bout, to be followed by multa,
a fine or forfeit3 in Plautus the fine is losing a cup of wine (not having to
drink an extra one) ; and this eulpa involving a malta, a forfeit, would serve
instead of an arbiter bibendi, or mayiste‘r. 124. venerata: passive, as
in Virg. Aen. 3. 460, and cf. od. 1. 1. 25 n. ita . . . alto: the very
