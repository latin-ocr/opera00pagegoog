he is in such hot haste because he is carrying a book to Augustus. 18.

come crowding round his messenger, eager to know what he has brought.

being regarded as fragile ware which Asina breaks by stumbling.

EPISTLE XIV

Nominally addressed to Horace's farm-bailiff‚ but really an apology for his
love for the country, intended for his friends at Rome. It thus takes up the
theme of 1. 10 and of the earlier part of 1. 7, while it is the reverse of S. 2. 7.

1-5. C'ome, bailvff, Zet us see whether you or I best do our duty. 1. Vilice :
the form invariably found in good MSS. and inscriptions. Lachmann on
Lucr. 1. 331 showed that Z not ll was used between a long i and a short one ε
so mille but milia, villa but vilicus: cf. Roby 177. The vilicus· was the
head slave on a farm, whose duty it was to look after the proper discharge of
all farm works: Cato de Re Rust. 142 vilici officia quae sunt, quae dominus
praecepit, ea omnia quae in fundo fieri oportet, quaeque emi pararique oportet.
eadem uti curet faciatque moneo, dominique dicto audiens sit. mihi me
reddentis, ‘that makes me my own master again‚’ i. e. where I can live as I
please, without being distracted by the endless claims made upon me at Rome.
The woods on Horace's Sabine estate are mentioned 1. 16. 9 3 Od. 3. 16. 29.

2. habitatum quinque focis, ‘though it furnishes a home for five families.' -—
Horace in S. 2. 7. 118 speaks of his familia rustica as consisting of eight
operae (‘ hands ’). But perhaps they tilled the ‘home-farm ’ under the vitiem,
while the patres were free cotom? (Od. 1. 35. 6 pauper ‘mc-ris colonus ‚· 2. 14.
12 sive inopes emimus coloni), who tilled the rest of the estate, paying to
Horace as the dominus either a fixed rent, or as so often now in Italy (the
metayer system) a portion of the produce. Others, as Ritter, explain ‘which
was once inhabited by five households of free colonif but we cannot so force
the meaning of habitatum. focis, ‘'households ε cf. Herod. 1. 176 αἱ δὲ
ὀγδώκοντα ἱστίαι αυτ-αι ἔτυχον τηνικαῦτα ἐκδημέουσαι, καὶ οὕτω περιεγένοντο.
3. Variam, a town on the Anio, eight miles above Tibur, on the ma Valerias‘*
Just where the valley of the Digentia, in which Horace’s estate lay, joined that
of the Anio, The patres probably went there to market, and for local elections,
etc. It is now called VicovarO. 4. spinas, used of vices or lesser failingsffi
in 2. 2. 212 : cf. also S. 1. 3. 34-37. ‘ Let us see which can root out the thorns
the more stoutly, I from my breast, or you from the land.' 5. res: fundus.

6-10. We dtffer very zoidely in our views os town and country tffe. 6.
Lamiae pietas et cura, ⁶ Lamia’s love and trouble ’ : this cannot mean, as
some have taken it, ‘ my love for Lamia ' t pietas seems never to be used with
an obJective genitive, and it does not seem often to denote an affection not
based upon any natural ties, such as exist in the case of parents or kinsmen.
For L. Aelius Lamia see Od. 3. 17 Intr. moratur has much more authority
than ‘moretur ; for quamvis in Horace cf. S. 2. 2. 30 ιι. ’7. maerentis . . .
dolentis: the assonance is imitative ; cf. 2. 2. 79. maereo is to express grief,
