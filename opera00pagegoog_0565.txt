get the god’s pardon for his deceit in the past, and his aid for similar tricks in
the future. 60. Laverna, the Roman equivalent to our Saiut N icholas:
cf. Shakespeare, 1 Henry IV, Π. 1. 67 ‘if they meet not with Saint Nicholas’
clerks, I’ll give thee this neck.’ Schol. Cruq. derives the name from latere,
because thieves, he says, were once called lateo-aiones and laverniones (cf.
Gadshill's words in Shakespeare, 1. c. 95 ‘we have the receipt of feru-seed, we walk
invisible ’). Acron connects it with lavare, thieves being called lat-atoma,
perhaps because they ‘ clean out ’ travellers. But the only legitimate derivation
is from the root lu or Zau ‘to gain‚' found in ἀπο-λαύ-ω, ληΐς, lucrum, latro,
etc. (Curt. Gr. Etym. 536). 61. da with inf„ as dones in Od. 1. 31. 17.
iusto sanctoque restored by Bentley from vet. Bland. and other good MSS.

63-72. One who is a slave to his baseo- passione is πο free man, but should
be treated as a oowardly prisoner of war, and set to some useful coil. 63.

triviis fixum: repeated by PerS. 5. 111 inque luto fixum possis transcendere
ammaum, where the scholiast says that it was a common joke with boys at
Rome to solder a coin to the pavement (assem in silice plumbatum infiqere) in
order to ridicule those who stooped to pick it up, crying ‘try again. ¹⁷ 66.

has flung away his arms. 69. captivum, i. e. a man who 1s absorbed in
the pursuit of money, is not worthy of the name of a free man: treat him as
a captive, and let him do the work for which heis fit. 70. durus, ‘un-
sparingly ' ι 1. 7. 91. 72. annonae prosit, cle.. let him serve to keep down
the price of corn, by bringing in plenty from abroad. For the effect of im·
ported corn on agriculture in Italy, cf. Mommsen, Hist. 3. 77. penusque:
this neuter form is quoted from Horace by Servius aud Priscian ε some inferior
MSS. have penum: Roby 398, S. G. 121. Cf. Cic. de Nat. D. 2. 27. 68 est

omne, quo vescuntur homines, penus.

73-79. A t‘mly qood man will φηαίπίαιή his searless independenoe. An
admirably vivid and dramatic adaptation of Eur. Bacch. 492-498. Dionysus,
in the guise of a young Lydian stranger, is brought before Pentheus, king of
Thebes, charged with introducing the Bacchic orgies among the Theban women.
74. patique: cf. 1. 15. 17; Cic. Tusc. 2. 7. 17 patietur, perferet, ozon suo·
cumbet. 75. indignum: cf. line 34. bona, in Euripides the long
tresses and the thyrsus, borne in honour of the god. 76. lectos, the most
