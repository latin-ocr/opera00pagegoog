‘ when men in their passion distinguish right and wrong (only) by the narrow
limit that lust determine8,' i.e. lust or passion induces men to neglect the
broad distinction between right and wrong, and persuades them that there is
very little difference between the two, in fact that they often shade absolutely

what it is and what it ought to have been is made very vivid.
