508 HORACE BOOK 1

honores et imperia ,· cf. Od. 1. 1. 7. Quiritis, collective, as so often in
Livy, but apparently not elsewhere before his time: cf. Tac. Germ. 37 non
Samnis, non Poeni.

9-16. The sear os loss or suffering] is not less disturbiny than the qreed for
yain or honour, and they are alilce in their effects : virtue herself should not be
pursued to an extreme. 9. fere, ‘as a rule'3 cf. Caes. B. G. 3. 18 fere
libenter homines id quod volunt, credunt. miratur, etc„ ‘ over-esteems
them in the same way as he who craves.' For mirari in this sense of caring
about, with some feeling of dread, cf. Luc. 2. 28 necdum est ille dolor, sed iam
metus,· incubat amens, Ι miraturque malum. 10. pavor, ‘the excitement ’
(cf. Cic. Tusc. 4. 8. 19 pavorem, metum mentem loco moventem): the θάμβος or
ἔκπληξις which is inconsistent with real happiness. Cf. Virg. Aen. 5. 137
exsultantiaque haurit} corda pavor pulsans of the excitement of a race.
utrobique, ‘iu either case.' 11. simul :simul ac; Roby 1717, S. G.
721. species, ‘ appearance' of any object of sear or desire. exterret,
‘flutters ’ with the pavor which it excites. Jacobs, approved by Lachmann,
conjectures externat (1.0. exsternat, ‘scares,' cf. consternat); but exterret is
sufficiently defended by Virg. 'Aen 11. 806 fuyit ante omnes exterritus
Arruns, Ι laetitia mixtoque metu ,· Lucr. 2. 1040 novitate exterritus ipsa.

12. gaudeat . . . ‘whether he rejoices or fears, . . . what matter?
This classification of the emotions under four heads originated with the
Stoics‚ but had become a commonplace. Cf. Virg. Aen. 6. 733 hinc metuunt
cupiuntque, dolent qaudentque,· Plat. Phaed. 83 Β ἡδονῶν καὶ ἐπιθυμιῶν καὶ
λυπῶν καὶ φόβων. 13. spe, ‘ expectation,' with the ambiguous meaning shown
also in pavor and exterret. This is more common with the verb spero (cf.
Virg. Aen. 1. 543, 2. 658) than with the substantive; but cf. Sall. Jug. 88. 1
contra spem suam laetissimis animis excipitur. 14. defixis oculis, ‘you
stare, look blank, grow numb from top to toe '—-Con. 16. ultra quam
satie est . . . The need of moderatiori in pursuit even of virtue is a com·
monplace with philosophers z cf. Cic. pro Mur. 30. 63 nostri illi . . . a Platone
et Aristotele, moderati homines et temperati, aiunt . . . omnes virtutes medio·
oritate quadam esse moderatas ; Tusc. 4. 25. 55 studia vel optimarum rerum
sedata tamen et tranquilla esse debent. ⁷

137-27. Set your affections on the treasures of art, on fame and on wealtli, if
you will: but remember that you'will soon have to abandon all. 17. 1 nunc,
‘go now‚' an ironical command to do something which after what has been
said is impossible, or absurd ; usually followed by et, as in 2. 2. 76. Cf. Juv.
10. 3103 12. 57; Pers. 4. 19 i nunc . . . suffla where Jahn remarks ‘irri-
dentis vel exprobantis formula! argentum, here ‘plate,' as S. 1. 4. 28 ;
not ‘money' artes, ‘works of art‚’ cf. Od. 4. 8. 5 n. 18. suspice,
opp. of despice. 0010100, ‘dyeS,’ i.e. vestes purpureas. 19. loquentem,
very rarely used, as here, of public speaking, which is almost always dicere,
opposed to conversational talk (loqui) ε cf. Cic. Orat. 32. 113 nec idem loqui est
quod dicere ,· de Orat. 3. 10. 38 neque enim conamur docere eum dicere, qui

due either to inheritance, or to his own energy and skill. emetat, only
found here. 22. Mutus, probably a real person, known to Horace's
