Quintus pavone ex Pythayorea Of course if he is as good a poet as Homer
he need not trouble himself whether he had once been Homer or not. 53.
non=nonne, as in Od. 3. 20. 1 non vides, and often elsewhere. Bentley first
gave the true meaning to this passage, by making it interrogative, ‘Did I say
that Ennius is now sure of his place? W‘hy even N aeviuS‚ so much more
archaic a writer, is still always in our hands, and familiar to us, as if he were
almost one of our own time‚' Naevius served in the first Punic War, and
therefore could not have been born later than about 260 13.c. ε 116 died about
200 B.c., while Ennius was born 239 B.c.‚ and died 169 B.c. His poetry
was decidedly more archaic than that of Ennius.

55-62. Even when the early writers are set ayainst each other, the question
is only which has the more striking} mer-its, not what are the saulis of each ,· and
the fashionable critias think they can be labelled by appropriate epithets in each
case. 55. aufert, ‘carries off ' as his special distinction. 56. Pacuvius
(219-129 13.c.), the sister’s son of Ennius. 'Phe extant fragments of his tragedies
(about 400 lines) do not enable us to determine precisely why the epithet of
doctus is given to him, but it is probably because of 1118 wide acquaintance
with Greek literature. Accius (170 Rex-about 90 Rc.) ε oratorical fervour
and passionate energy are conspicuous in his fragments (cf. Sellar, 146-7).
Quintilian says (10. 1. 97) virium Attio plus tribuitur, Pacuvium videri docti-
orem, qui esse docti adfectant, volunt. Both Pacuvius and Accius attained to

57. Afrani toga: bene toga: toqatas enim scripsit A sranius—Porph. 'I'he
togatae were comedjes, depicting Roman or Italian characters and manners, as
opposed to the palliatae, comedies like those 01· Plautus and Terence derived
from Greek 80111668, and retaining Greek dramatis personae. L. Afranius was
born about 150 B.c. : his plays were of a very immoral character, but in style
they attained to something of the elegance of Terence. He freely borrowed
from Menander, as well as from other writers (cf. Macrob. S. 6. 1. 4 Afranius
toyatarum scriptor . . . non inverecunde respondens arquentibus quod plura
sumpsisset a Menandro ‘Fate0r,' inquit ‘sumpsi non ab illo modo sed ut quis-
que habuit conveniret quod mihi, quod ‘me non posse melius facere credidi, etiam
a Latino ’) and the eritics pronounced that his style was worthy of his model.
58. ad exemplar Epicharmi: it is difficult to determine the exact mean-
ing of this line, because we have not the means of comparing Plautus with
Epicharmus, of whose comedies we have few considerable fragments preserved.
Orelli takes properare ( :ad eventum festinare A. P. 148) of the rapid pro-
gress of the action of the plays. Mahaffy says that ‘it seems only to apply
to the easy flow of the dialogue ’ (Greek Lit. 1. 403) ; but Sellar is more nearly
right 111 extending it to ‘ the extreme vivacity and rapidity of gesture, dialogue‚
declamation and recitative, by which his soenes were character-ised ’ (Roman
Pocts, 194). It must always be remembered‚ though many critics seem 10
forget this, that Horace is not giving his own opinions, but those which were
commonly current. Epicharmus was born in Cos about 540 B.c.‚ but was
brought as an infant to Megara in Sicily, and enjoyed much reputation at the
court of Hiero in Syracuse about 490 B.c. 59. Caecilius Statius, an
Insubrian Gaul by birth, flourished at Rome at the same time as Ennius, dying
one year after him in 168 B.c. He was placed at the head of all the Roman
