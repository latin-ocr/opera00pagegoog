Cratino: the fondness of Cratinus for wine was the subJect of many Jests
among his contemporaries· Aristophanes in the Peace (700-703) says that he
died of grief at seeing a jar full oswine smashed in an invasion of the Lacedae-
monians. The schol. on Eq. 400 states that in his play of the Πυτίνη Cratinus
represented himself as lawfully married to Κωμῳδὶα, who wished to leave him,
and to bring an action against him for neglect, because he had deserted her for
Μέθη. 2. placere diu go together, for vivere needs no adverb, cf. Od.4. 9.
11. 3. potoribus: some take this as ablative, cf. temtore line 13. Most
strongly support the dative (Roby 1146, S. G. 476), a construction found
twice at least in Virgil (Aen. 1. 440 neque cernitur παῖ,- 3. 398 medis
habitantur moenia Grais), several times in Ovid (Her. 9. 46 ; Fast. 2. 61 ;
3. 108, 325; 5. 110; 303), while Madvig allows in Livy 5. 6. 14 nou uui
aut alteri militi . . . audiuntur and 1. 23. 10 quaerentibus utrinque ratio
initur. For apparent instances in Cicero (6.9. de Seu. 11. 38) cf. Madvig on
de Fin. 1. 4. 11. Here direct agency is denoted: in line 13 textore indicates
rather the instrumentality, ‘by the help of ² or ‘thanks to.' Both these
cases differ materially from those in which the abl. of the substantive is
accompanied by an adj., for which see 1. 1. 94 11. ut, ‘ever since,'
cf. Od. 4. 4. 42 n.‚ Roby 1719, S. Gr. 723. The Muses drank at first
only from springs like Castalia and Hippocrene: but since the days when
Bacchus ‘ enrolled ' (tauquam iu Zeyiouem suam .· πανὺ hoc verbum mititare est
Porph.) the frenzied poets among his troop of followerS, they too have borne
the traces of their nightly potations. male sanos: cf. Od. 1. 9. 24 n.
The inspired frenzy of poets has been a commonplace at least since the days of
Democritus. Cf. Cic. Div. 1. 37. 80 ἠ69αέ siue furore Democritus quemquam
poetam myrtum esse posse, quod idem dicit Plato (Phaedr. 245 A). Of. A. P.
2953 S. 2. 3. 322. 4. Satyris Faunisque: the Satyrs were always
regarded as attendants of Bacchus: cf. Od. 2. 19. 4. The Fauns are here
introduced as typifying the earliest Italian poetry z cf. Ennius in Cic. Brut. 19.
71 versibus quos otim Fauni vatesque cauebant ,· Mommsen, Hist. 1. 230 : ‘ the
earliest chant in the view of the Romam, was that which the leaves sang to
themselves in the green solitude of the forest. The whispers and pipings of
the “ favourable spirit ” (Faunus from favere) in the grove were repeated to men
by the singer (vates), or by the songstress (ca-smenon, carmarita) who had the gift
of listening to him, with the accompaniment of the pipe, and in rhythmically
measured language (casmen, afterwards carmen, from cauere).’ 5. fere,
‘as arule': cf. 1. 6. 9.

6. laudibus vini: i. 6. by the epithets which he applies to it, μελιηδής,
μελίφρων, ἡδύποτος, εὐήνωρ, μενοεικήςε cf. Π. 6. 261 ἀνδρὶ δὲ κεκμηῶτι μένος
μέγα οἶνος ἀέξει. vinosus=viuosus fuisse. 7. pater, a term of
respect for the father of Roman poetry: cf. Prop. 3. 2. 6 uude pater sitiens
Ennius aute bibit .· and Plato's ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν Παρμενίδης. There may also be
a reference to the fact that he lived in days of old (cf. senis of Lucilius in S. 2.
1. 34). Ennius said of himself numquam poetar, nisi si podaqer. 8. prosiluit,
‘sprang forth,' as if eager to take part himself in the wars of which he was
singing. He dwelt most fully in his Annals on the war with Pyrrhus,
the Second Punic war, the Macedonian, the Aetolian and the Istrian
ware. For the puteal Libonis in the forum used by business men and
money—lenders, cf. S. 2. 6. 35 11. 9. Siccis: cf. Od. 1. 18. 3. severis:
cf. Catull. 5. 2 ruorwresque senum severiorum. 10. edixi: used with moek
solemnity ‘ I laid down this law,’ as in S. 2. 2. 51 ; 3. 227, with a reference to
