260 HORACE Boox 11

durum, but dirum, the epithet applied to Hannibal 3. 6. 36 and 4. 4. 42, is
appropriate and almost necessary here. Two centuries after the invasion 01
Hannibal there still lived in Italy ‘the terror of his name ’z he was still
‘ Hannibal the Dread’ ; with his name that epithet was indissolubly united.
How then could Horace, especially here, where he is selecting typical instances
of great wars and warriorS, venture on such a parody of dirus as durus?
It would be as pardonable to call Wellington not the ‘Great Duke,' but the
‘ Grand Duke.' Siculum mare . . . : referring to the victories 01 C.
Duilius at Mylae, with the first fleet the Romans ever built, B.0. 260, and
to that 01 Lutatius Catulus at the Aegatian Islands, B.0. 242. Cf. 3. 6. 34.
3. Poeno purpureum. The conjunction of these adjectives is remarkable,
considering the notoriety 01 ‘Phoenician purple ' : it is probably an oversight.
mollibus aptari citharae mod-ie, ⁴ be set to the lyre's gentle measures.'
aptari 6. m. expresses the fitting or adjustment 01 3 subject to such metres
as are suited for the accompaniment 01 the lyre. mollibus: 80 1. 6. 10
inbellis lyrae. Horace in both cases selects the epithet to assist his excuse,
' not because he regards lyric poetry as universally ‘unwarlike' and ‘gentle.'
He was well aware 01 its capability to sound a graver note3 61. next Ode
line 26, and 101 admirable instances the first six Odes of Book 3.

5. nimium mero, ‘ wild with wine ' 3 61. Τ36. Hist. 4. 23 rebus secundis
nimii. Hylaeus was one of the Centaurs 3 101· their battle with the Lapithae,
61. 1. 18. 7 11. ’7. Telluris iuveneszvivavres ‘the Earthborn.' For their
attack on heaven, cf. 2. 19. 21-24 and notes. unde periculum . . .
domus, ‘ at the danger 01 whose attack the bright abode of ancient Saturn
shook with 1631.’ unde, ‘whence'z‘from whom,’ ‘at whose hands.' peri-
culum is 366. 311361 contremuit, which though intransitive becomes transitive
(61. 2. 13. 26 n.)=‘to quake' or ‘shake with sear at.' For the sense cf.
J oel ii. 10 ‘The earth shall quake before them3 the heavens shall tremble.'
8. fulgens: because the sky is the abode 01 light and brightness‚ cf. 3. 3. 33
lucidas sedes ‘ the halls 01 light‚’ i. e. heaven.

9. tuque . . . Must be Maecenas, though we know nothing of his
having attempted such a work. pedestribus, ‘prose '3 cf. S. 2. 6. 17 n.
10. historiis: ἱστορία, ‘an enquiry,’ then ‘a history'3 61. Herod. 1. 1
ἱστορίης ἀπόδειξις ἥδε, ‘this display of the results 01 my enquiry.' In 3.
7. 20 historias = ‘stories‚' ‘legends.' 11. per vias: especially up the
‘ Sacred Way ² to the summit 01 the Capitol. 12. colla : with reference to
the chains on their necks; 61. Epod. 7. 7. 13. me . . . z in strong
contrast to tu. dominae . . . Licymniae, ‘ 13116. Queen of hearts
Licymnia.’ Under the nom-de-plume of Licymnia (Λὶκυμνίαε 61. dulces
cantus λιγεῖς ὕμνοι) Horace refers to Terentia the wife 01 Maecenas. The
fact that the two names are identical in scansion makes this very probable:
the Ode would be sent privately with the real name, but be published with
the fictitious one substituted. So too Catullus puts Lesbia 101 Clodia,
Tibullus Delia 101· Plania. Moreover the fact that Licymnia (line 20) takes
part in the festival of Diana shows that she must have been a Roman lady.
domina (dominus ‘ a master of slaves ') = ‘ one who holds hearts in thrall.’
14. lucidum sumentes, ‘brightly (cf. 1. 22. 23 n.) sparkling.' 15.
bene fidum, ‘ firmly faithful? the adverb confirms the 10166 01 fidus,
as male would obliterate it (male fidus: ‘ unfaithful '). Cf. 1. 17. 25 11.

17. quam nec dedecuit, ‘in whom it was not unbecoming . . . ‚⁹ i.e.
‘ most becoming '3 Litotes, cf. 1. 18. 9 n. ferre pedem choris, ‘to move
