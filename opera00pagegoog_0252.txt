ODE XXII

‘ The just ancl innocent need no promnion, Fuscus, throuylz whatever
danyers their path Zeads them. At any ‘rate I know that a monstrons wolf
aia not attaclc me while I was wanderiny in tlze woods thinking] of Lalaye. In
any climate I shall feel sase and contentedly siny my lady's charone?

For Aristius Fuscus see Ep. 1. 10. 3 and Intr.

1. integer vitae, ‘he who is blameless in (respect to) his life ’ ; cf. Ovid
Met. 9. 441 inteqer aevi. The grammarians call it the gen. of respect. For
inteyer cf. 2. 4. 22 11. sceleris: partitive gen„ purus being=having no
share in. 2. Mauris. Merely pictorial. 5. Syrtes aestuosas. Orelli
explains ‘the scorching desert that borders the Syrtes,’ cf. aestuosa Calabria
1. 31. 5. It seems simplet· to take Syrtes 111 its ordinary sense, ‘the boiling'
or ‘ stormy Syrtes‚' cf. 2. 6. 3 barbaras Syrtes ‘abi Maura semper Ι aestuat
unda. 6. inhospitalem. Aesch. P. V. 20 calls the Caucasus ἀπάνθρωπος
πάγος. 7. fabulosus Hydaspes. This river (the Jelum) is a tributary
of the Indus: on its banks Alexander defeated Porus (B.0. 327). It is called
fabulosus as being in the unexplored East, about which numberless stories

would be current at Rome. 8. lambit, ‘ washes.’

9. namque. He proves his general statement by an instance that had
occurred to himself. In 3. 4. 9, where the birds cover him with leaves for
protection‚ he claims the· same almost sacred poetic character 3 cf. 2. 17, and
di me tuentur 1. 17. 13. 10. et ultra . . . ‘and wandered beyond my
boundaries in utter carelessneSS, a wolf fied from me though unarmed, a
monster such as neither . . . ' 11. curis expeditis. Cares harass and
hamper us (inpediunt) 3 hence, curis mpeditss, when the bonds of care are
unloosened‚ a man is at ease, careless: it was in such a moment of perfect
freedom and poetic abstraction that Horace ran into danger.

14. Daunias. Part of Apulia near Mt. Garganus 3 30 called from Daunus
who there founded a kingdom.. The word is formed on the model of Gk.
adjectives feminine; cf. Τρωάς, Ἰλιάς. 15. Iubae tellus, ae. Mauretania
or Numidia. Juba I.‚ king of Numidia, committed suicide after the battle of
Thapsus. His son was made king of Numidia by Augustus, B.o. 30, and in
B.o. 25 received Mauretania instead ι the latter date is fixed by some as the
date of the Ode. 16. arida nutrix : oxymoron.

17. pigris campis, ‘lifeless plains ’ ; i. e. the frigid zones. For a descrip-
tion of the five zones, two frigid‚ two temperate, and one torrid‚ see Virg.
Gr. 1. 233-239. For piyris cf. ineo-8, 2. 9. 5 n. 19. quod. latus . . .
‘that quarter of the world over which ever lower mists and an ungenial
sky.’ For latus, cf. 3. 24. 38. 22. domibus negata, i.e. uninhabit-
able. According to virgil, l. c.‚ the temperate zones alone were habitable.
23. dulce ridentem. dulce 13 really a cognate acc. As you can say dulcem
risam ridere, you can say more briefly dulce ridere. So 3. 27. 67 perfidum
ridere, 2. 12. 14 lucidam falqente53 2. 19. 6 turbidum laetatur ,· S. 2. 4. 18
malum responset, 2. 5. 100 certum viyilans, 2. 6. 27 clare certumque locuto,
and Hom. 11. 2. 270 ἡδὺ γελᾶν.

ODE XXIII

‘ You avoid me like a timia saum, Chloe, that is friyhtened at every sound.
Yet I am no τίθεν or Zion, and you are old enouyh to quit your mother’s sida’
