soldum may mean that Nasica had borrowed money from Coranus, and was
afraid he would be called upon to pay, and gave him his daughter as a set—off ε
but it is better to take it more generally, that Nasica was unable to meet his
debts ε metuentis would then be like Od. 2. 2. 7 pinna ‘metuente solvi:
6 unable ’ or ‘ unwilling.' soldum=solidum, seems to have been technically
used of paying the full amount, ‘twenty shillings in the pound,’ as we say3
cf. Cic. Rab. Post. 17. 46 ita bona veneant ut solidum suum cuique solvatur.
66. tabulas=cera3‚ ‘his will.' 69. praeter plorare: it is difficult in
such cases to say whether praeter is prep. or adv.3 cf. Ov. Her. 7. 164 quod
crimen dieis· praeter amasse meum? ¹70. illud, ‘ 11113,’ like ἐκεῖνο, refers to
what follows: cf. 1. 4. 643 2. 3. 150. ad haec, ‘moreover.'

- 84. me. sene: if a living person, not a shade, had been speaking, 116
111031 likely would have said me puero. inproba, ‘ bold,’ as her audacious
codicil showed. 85. ex, 6 111 accordance with.' elata, ‘ carried to her
pyre ’ 3 cf. ἐκφέρειν, ἐκφορά. 87. si, ‘to try if,' 6 common use of εἰ. 89.
operae 3 dative, but opera must be supplied after abundes. Siesbyus’ opera
is, however, very likelyt cf. Caes. ap. Gell. 13. 3. 5 equidem mila· videor nou
labore non opera uon industria defuisse. 90. difficilem, δύσκολον, ‘ peevish. ’
morosum, ‘wayward‚' -‘ capriciouS.’ ultra non etiam sileae, 6 you
must not be too silent either,' or 6 (1011’1 be too silent either‚’ according as nou
sileas is regarded as ‘potential conjunctive ' (Kiessling, Orelli 4) or as a pro-
hibition, ‘non being put for ue 3 which N ettleship (on Aen. 12. 78 nou Teucros
ayat in Rutulos) says can be done ‘if a particular part of the sentence is to
be emphasised,' or where there is strong opposition. Cf. Ep. 1. 18. 72 ; Ρ613.
1. 5 ; 5. 45 3 Ov. A. A. 3. 129, 133. Quintilian 1. 5. 50 66Π3 noufeceris for ue
feceris a solecism. For ultra cf. Quint. 8. 6. 76 meliusque ultra quam citra
stat oratio, where ultra is adverb, equivalent to ultra modum. 91. Davus
comicus, ‘ like Davus in the play,' what particular play is uncertain: cf.
A. P. 95 tragicus Telephus ; Prop. 4. 5. 44 amnica moecha. 92. obstipo:
011 0116 side, and stooped forward in the attitude of eager attention. Pers. 3.
80 obstipo eapite et fiyeutes lumine terram.

93. obsequio, ‘ by civilities? grassare, ‘ make your advances.' gyras-
sari has not here its stronger sense of ‘ attack‚' whence yrassator, a footpad
or highwayman, 13 derived. , si increbruit aura, ‘if the wind freshens!
95. aurem substringe, ‘ gather your ear up ' (with your hand). The
action is that of a person who is afraid of losing a syllable, commonly seen in
deas persons. 96. inportunus: Prof. J. B. Mayor (Cic. de N. D. 32.
81) explains this word as strictly, like importuosus, of a coast which has no
harbours : then (1) ‘ unfavourable,' ‘unseasonable,' the opposite of opportunus;
(2) ‘storm-tost,' ‘restless‚' ‘troublesome' (our ‘importunate'), as 111 Ep. 1.
18. 23 aryenti sitis inportuna ,· (3) ‘threatening,’ ‘ dangerous,' ‘pitiless.'
Horace uses it Od. 4. 13. 9=‘pitiless' 3 Od. 3. 16. 37: ‘troublesome,' and so
S. 1. 8. 6 ; Ep. 2. 2. 85, where it is perhaps ‘restless.' Here it seems to mean
‘in season and out of season,' so that the man becomes a nuisance, and so
too Ep. 1. 6. 54 of a man who can make himself ‘awkward.' 5116 iam,
‘ hold, enough.' ohe iam satis est is the full phrase. Persius uses ὂῘιε even
without iam in thissense, 1. 23. 111 1. 5. 12 &he is the quantity. Cf. Mart.
4. 91. 1 ohe iam satis est ohe libelle, where both quantities are given in one
line. 97. Urgum, ‘ply him with praise.’ 98. crescentem utrem,
‘blow him up like a wine-skin, so 63 to swell with your turgid praise ’3 cf.
Falstaff in 1 Henry IV Π. iv. 365 ‘ A plagae of sighing and grief ! it blows α
man up like a bladder!
