226 ’ HORACE f Boox 1

ullum inveniet parem, ‘when shall (she) ever find a peer'3' Of. Milton’s
Lycidas 8 ‘For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime, Ι Young Lycidas, and
hath not left his peer.' inveniet. For the singular verb cf. 2. 13. 38 n.

11. tu frustra . . . ‘vainly devout thou claimest from the gods
Quintilius, entrusted to them on no such terms,’ zle. you have frequently
prayed the gods to keep Quintilius, but you did not mean that they should
thus keep him wholly and for ever. Others take creditum: ‘1ent‚' i.e. to you
by the gods, but ‘the person poscit qui credidz‘t’ (Kiessling). frustra seems
to go with both pius and poscis. 13—15. quodsi . . . non, ‘and yet if
more persuasively than Thracian Orpheus thou didst rule a lyre which even
the trees obey, the life-blood would not revisit the shadowy form.' The
MSS. give quid si . . . ‘num . . . z‘what think you, if you were to . . .
would the life-blood . . . 2' This seems weaker than the downright quodsi
and the emphatic and direct non. Nauck, who so reads, punctuates better τ
quid? si . . . Orpheo: 1. 12. 11 n. 16. virga: 1. 10. 18 11.

17. non lenis . . . ‘not easily persuaded to open the barriers of fate,’
cf. Prop. 4. 11. 2 panditur ad nullas ianua niqra preces. 'Phe gate of death
opens only to admit, never to give egress. non 161116, litotes: recludere,
epexegetic. 18. nigro compulerit gregi, ‘has folded with the children
of darkness.' The dat. after the sense of ‘add to,’ ‘join to' contained in
compulerit. 20. quidquid . . . ‘whatever the laws of heaven forbid us
to amend.' ius=human law, faszdivine law.

ODE XXV

A coarsely expressed Ode to Lydia, who Horace says will soon be an old
woman without the charms, but retaining the passions of her youth, and
destined to meet with the same contempt she now employs towards her lovers.

2. iactibus. So the best MSS„ not ictibus. It is easier to ‘throw ' some-
thing at a chamber—window to attract attention than to ⁴ strike ' or ‘ beat ' it.
3. amat limen, ‘keeps close to the threshold '3 cf. Virg. Aen. 5. 163 litus
ama ‘ hug the coast.' 6. audis minus et minus iam. Accommodation
of sound to sense: the words form a diminuendo. 7. me . . . ‘though
Ι your lover am tortured through the long nights, my Lydia, do you sleep 2 ’
9. invicem . . . ‘in your turn you shall bewail the haughtiness of men, a
despised hag in a deserted alley.' 11, 12. sub interlunia, ‘towards the
new moon.' Changes of the moon are popularly supposed to be accompanied
by changes of the weather. For interllunia see Notes on Metres p. xix. ἓ 1.

15. iecur ulcerosum, ‘your diseased beart! 1¹7. laeta quod . . .
‘ because J'oyous youth revels rather in green ivy and dusky myrtle, (but)
dedicates withered leaves to winter’s friend the Hebrus ' t i.e. because young
girls are preferred to old women, as fresh foliage is to faded. For the
metaphor cf. our phrase ‘, the sere and yellow leaf,' and Aesch. Ag. 79 τὸ δ’
ὑπέργηρων φυλλάδος ἤδη κατακαρφομένης. virenti and pulla are in
artistic contrast with each other and both opposed to aridas. quod . . .
gaudeat, ‘because (as you will say regretfully to yourself) . . . youth
rej0ices ' ε it is virtually oblique narration. 20. dedicet Hebro, ‘flings far
away,’ cf. next Ode line 2, the Hebrus being selected as a river in a waste and
wintry country (cf. Thracio vento above) where the warmth of youth and love
is unknown. The correction Ewo is needless. gaudeat . . . dedicet:
co-ordination of contrasted clauseS. In English we should insert ‘ but' ; the
