vanis ‘rebeus‘ .· cf. 2. 8. 83 fictis rerum3 A. Ρ. 49 abdita rerum, and see Ep. 1.
17. 21 n. ; rerum is a partitive gen„ but Propertius loses sight of this
when he goes so far as to write omnia rerum, 3. 9. 7.

’ 28. ῃῠῑῑι adest ι a relic of the time when a syllable ending in -m was re-
garded as short, and as not cut off before a vowel, any more than a syllable ending
in —n; cf. Lucr. 3. 1082 sed dum abest quod avemus id exsuperare videtur ,-

inritata canes quam homo quod planius dicit. 29. carne tamen . . .
petere, ⁴ nevertheless, though there is no difference in flesh, to think that you
prefer the one (illam, the flesh of the peacock) to the other, taken in by dispari ty
of outward appearance !' For the inf. of exclamation, cf. Epod. 8. 1 rogare
Ionyo putidam te saeculo Ι vires quid enervet meas! Porph. j0ined esto with
petere, ‘grant that you may prefer ’ (and so Kiessling‚ placing a colon after
esto), and this explanation is also satisfactory, though Bentley objects that
the concessive esto always begins a sentence, as Ep. 1. 1. 81 esto aliis alios
rebus studiisque teneri. The reading patet found in some MSS. and illa found
in many have caused much difficulty. Madvig suggests carne tamen, quam vis,
discat nihil lzac mayis illa. Ι inpartibus formis deceptum te patet. esto . . .
taking maqis (= μαγίς, cf. Pliny, H. N. 33. 11) as ‘a dish,' i.e. in fiesh however,
not appearance, one dish does not differ from the other. High praise has been
given to this suggestion, but the improbability of mayis after an abl. having
this strange meaning is immense. See Palmer. quamvis distat: for
Horace's fondness for quamvis with ind. see Palmer.

30. esto, ‘let that pass ἰ concessive. Grant there is some reason why
you should be taken in in the case of the peacock, what grounds have you for
distinguishing between fishes? · 31. unde datum sentis, ‘ where did you
get your sense of perception ' ε imitated by Pers. 5. 124 unde datum hoc sumis 2
Tiberinus, i.e. Tiberinusne sit. ‚Lucilius calls the pike Tibem'nus catillo, 6 the
lick·plate of the 'I'iber‚' 1181 D illum sumina ducebant atque altilium lanx Ι
hunc pontes Tiberinus duo inter captus catillo, and Macrobius, Sat. 3. 16,
quotes from C. Titius, who lived in the time of Lucilius lupum ¹qermunum qui
inter duos pontes captus fuit. What two bridges are meant in these passages
is uncertain ι but probably the expression means off the Insula Tiberina, which
was commonly spoken of as inter duos pontes, 32. hiet, of the dead fish
with its open mouth. iactatus: Columella, R. R. 8. 16. 4 docta et erudita
palata fastidire docuit (Marcius Philippus) fiuvialem lupum nisi quem Tiberis
adverso torrente desetiyasset. 33. Sub, ‘just outside ²: see on 2. 8. 43.
Tusci, the Tiber, which rises in Etruria3 Od. 3. 7. 28. trilibrem mullum:
a mullet seldom exceeded 21bs.‚ Ph'n. Η. N. 9. 17. 64 : a monster of 61bs. was
bought by Crispinus for 6000 sesterces (2850) 3 Juv. 4. 153 cf. Mart. 3. 45.
5 ; 10. 37. 7. 34. quem . . . necesse est: not mentioned as an ad-
vantage, or reason why the gourmet prefers a large mullet, but as an objection‚
as necesse shows. Horace says you may as well have small fish, for if you
have a large one, you have to cut it into separate helps (pulmenta), wlu'ch
comes to the same thing as giving each person a whole small one.

35. ducit: allicit, ‘ attracts.' species, ‘ outward form‚' as in the case of
the peacock and the large mullet. 36. proceros, ‘long ' : proceris palmis Cat.
64. 261. quia before scilicet z see 1. 10. 72. 37. What is rare is prized :

small pikes, large mullets. 38. ieiunus raro are to be closely joined.
39. magno magnum : the amplitude of the mullet is expressed in grand
