urbanitatis mirae libertatisque .· cf. Val. Max. 6. 2. 12 vir iuris civilis scientia
claras, qua-m periculose contumax l). 372. 111 pretio est, ‘ has his value ' :
a regular phrase of persons or things which not holding the highest place, are
yet of some value3 cf. Plaut. Asin. 1. 1. 46 tu primus sentis: nos tamen in
pretio sumus ‚· Poen. 1. 2. 117 primum prima salva sis et secunda tu secundo
salve in pretio: tertia salve extra pretium. 373. 11011 1100111103, 11011 di :
some MSS. invert these clauses, but columnae comes 111 1110011 better as an anti-
climax with the order in the text: the word is itself a burlesque exaggeration
of the usual term pilae (cf. S. 1. 4. 71 n.) for the posts in front of the book-
sellers’ shops. We may translate‘ c'ounters?

374. symphonia: any kind of orchestral or choral music: so pueri
symphoniaci (Cic. pro Mil. 21. 55) are singing- boys: but the oxymoron is
doubtless intentional. 010010 often speaks of the symphonia as an accompani-
ment of banquets. 375. crassum· . thickness was generally considered a
fault in the perfumed unguents, supplied by the hosts at a dinner, for which
cf. Od. 2. 3. 133 7. 23; 3. 14. 7. Sardo melle: Porph. says Gorsicum

plants (Virg. Ecl. 7. 41 090 Sardoniis m'dear tibi amarior herbis) and the
yews which grew there. papaver: cf. Pliny H. N. 19. 53. 168 papaver
candidum, cuius semen tostum in secunda mensa cum melle apud antiquos
dabatur. The Spartans in Sphacteria were supplied with μήκων μεμελιτωμένη,
to allay hunger ; Τ1100. 4. 26. 376. duci cena : like aetatem ducimus Ep.
2. 2. 2Ο2; vita ducenda est Epod. 17. 63, etc. The sense is: such things
being unnecessary‚ should be of the best quality or not offered at all. 377.
natum: cf. line 82. 378. decessit, ‘ has fallen short of.' vergit ad.
imum, ‘ approaches the lowest ’ 1 i.e. is little better than the worst.

380. pilae: indoctus nowhere else 13 followed by the gen. but cf. sollers
lyrae line 407, Od. 1. 15. 24 n. For hall-play cf. S. 2. 2. 11 11. The ball
and quoit were held in high esteem, but the hoop (trochus) was rather despised :
cf. od. 3. 24. 57. 381. spissae : cf. line 205 and Ep. 1. 19. 41. inpune

construction cf. Cic. pro Flacc. 32. 80 voluisti maynum aori modum censeri
. . . census es praeterea numeratae pecuniae centum triyinta Η S. milia. The
construction with abl. is more common. For the equestrian census cf. Ep. 1. 1.

57. 384. vitio . . ., 110. ‘there is nothing against him': cf. Ep. 1. 7. 56.

385·'390. Even ifyou are well qualified to write do not be in haste to publish.
385. tu: 30. maior Pisonum. dices, ‘ will, Ι 0111 3010, say.' invita
Minerva: explained by Cic. de Off. 1. 31. 110 neque enim attinet naturae
repuqnare nec quicquam sequi, quod assequi non queas, ex quo magis ammovit,
quale sit decorum illud, ideo quia nihil decet invita Minerva, ut aiunt, id est
adversante et repuqnante natura. Of. note on crassa Minerva S. 2. 2. 3.
