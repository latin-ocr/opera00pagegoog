and δέρμα cot-respond to ossa and pelle here, and ossa atque pellis esse, ‘to be
a bag of bones,' is proverbial 3 cf. Plaut. Capt. 1. 2. 26 ; Α111. 3. 6. 28.
25. urguet . . . ‘ night treads on the heels of day and day of night, and yet
it is not possible . . .' Notice the inverted order of the cases in diem nox et
dies noctem. The repetition emphasises the idea of ceaseless continuity‚ as in
our phrases ‘ year by year,' ‘ day by day,' etc. 26. tenta spiritu,
‘ strained with sighing.' 27. negatum . . . ‘I am driven to believe what
I denied, (namely) that . . .’ 28. increpare, cf. od. 4. 15. 2 11., seems here
= ‘move (by the terror of their sound),' and so almostzincantare. Sabella
. . . Marsa . . . (60) Paelignas z witches seem to have abounded among these
old-fashioned mountain tribes ; cf. 5. 76; S. 1. 9. 29. 29. dissilire, ‘is
racked with pain ' 3 cf. our ‘ splitting headache.'

31. Hercules. Cf. 3. 17. 32. Sicana. fervida.. Note the quantitieS.
33. virens: most explain ‘flourishing‚’ ‘vigorous‚' cf. such phrases as πυρὸς
ἄνθος (in Lucr. flammai flore coorto) and φλὸξ ἐμαράνθη. Orelli gave ⁶ green':
sulphurous ; Peerlkamp :salma-3, cf. Plaut. Men. 5. 2. 76 viden tu illi oculos
virere ; Kiessling strangely derives the word from vis vires, making the i long.
The readings of some MSS. are clear corrections, Virens becoming Vrens and
Furens, tu . . . ‘ (but) thou dost glow a workshop with Colchian poisons
until, burnt to ashes, I am scattered abroad by the insulting winds.' The
language is strange, but not unsuited to the highly unnatural character of the
Epode. Canidia is spoken of as herself ‘a workshop aglow with poisons ' or
‘magic spe118,' because she is at work keeping the magio fire aglow, in which
she burns various obJects, in order that, as they consume away, so Horace also
may consume away. This method of affecting a person by burning an image
of him (cf. line 76; Theocr. 2. 28), or something that belonged to him or
symbolised him (cf. Virg. Ecl. 8. 84 Daphnis me malus urit, eqo hanc in
Daphnide Zaurum; Theocr. 2. 23-26) was regular in witchcraft. 34. iniuri-
osis: cf. Od. 1. 35. 13. 36. stipendium, ‘tribute,' ‘penalty,' ζημία, and
so exactly :poenas in the next line.

39. centum iuvencos, zze. as an expiatory sacrifice, ἑκατόμβη. Sive
. . . ‘ or whether thou shalt choose to be hymned by my untruthful lute,
(then) thou ‘⁶ chaste,'' thou “virtuous,’' shalt traverse the stars a golden
constellation.' The language is mock-heroic and satirica] in the extreme.
mendaci has two meanings: (1) that lied when it reviled you, (2) that will
lie when it calls you chaste. 40. sonari: Od. 2. 13. 26 n. pudica, proba:
the epithets are those which he will use of her in his palinode. The allitera-
tion and repetition of tu emphasise the sarcasm. For the highly comio per-
ambulabis cf. 4. 5 n. and Od. 4. 5. 17. Of course ‘traversing the stars,’
ete„ is heroic language for ‘being deified! 42. infamis . . . ‘angry on
account of libelled Helen, Castor and the brother of mighty Castor yielding to
prayer restored . . .’ See Od. 1. 16 Intr. For vioe many MSS. give vicem ;
both are good Latin, though the acc. is more usual. infamis, i.e. who
was made infamous by the account given of her by Stesichorus in his Ἰλίου
πέρσις. Castor and Pollux were Helen’s brothers as being sons of Leda.
For the phrase Castor . . . fraterque magni Castoris, cf. Catuli. 4. 27
gemelle Castor et qemelle C'astmis.

46. p. obsoleta sordibus, ‘sullied with hereditat-y squalor' ; cf. Od. 2.
10. 6. 47. prudens . . . ‘a hag skilled to scatter (for inf. cf. Od. 1. 3.
25 11.) the newly buried ashes.' The ninth day after death witnessed the final
completion of all funeral rites (cf. Apul. Met. 9. 31 nono die completis apud
