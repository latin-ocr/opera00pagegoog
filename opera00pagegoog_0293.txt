(Auster), that blows from Africa and the Sahara ; cf. S. 2. 6. 18. 16. cor-
poribus: governed partly by nocentem, partly by metuemus.

17. ater: a general epithet of things inferna13 cf. atras aures 2. 13. 34.
flumine languido: cf. palus used of the Styx by Virg. 1. e. 18. Cocytos

loud.’ Danai genus. For the daughters of Danaus, see Class. Dict. and
3. 11. 23 to end. 19. damnatus longi laboris, After verbs of con-
demning, acquitting‚ etc„ a gen. of the charge (e.g. damnatus furti) is regular3
but here louyi laboris is not the charge but the sentence, ‘ condemned to end-
less toil.' So Livy has damnatus voti, ‘ condemned to pay the thing vowed ' 3
Cic. Verr. 2. 3. 11 damnare octupli: Wickham considers it a gen. of estima-
tion 01 valuing. longi: 2. 16. 30 n. 20. Sisyphus: cf. Epod. 17. 68.

21. linquenda. By its pointed position in strong contrast with visendus
at the commencement of the preceding stanza. placens: a perfect epithet.
23. invisas, ‘hateful‚' not because the cypress itself is ugly but as being
sacred to Plut0, and constantly associated with death: it is called funebris
Epod. 5. 18, feralis Virg. Aen. 6. 216. 24. brevem dominum, ‘their
short-lived lordss For brevem, cf. 2. 3. 13 breves flores rosae, and for a similar
satire on the application of such terms as ‘ownership ’ to men who are at
best but tenants with short leases cf. Ep. 2. 2. 170-180. brevis domiuus is in
fact a sort of oxymoron: legally dominus is the possessor in perpetuity, as
opposed to one who is only a tenant or holder under a lease 3 brevis domiuus,
‘ an owner for a short time,' is therefore strictly a contradiction in terms.

25. Caecuba, sc. vina, from a district in Latium near Fundi. dig-
nior, i.e. because he uses and enjoys it, the epithet being added with ‘ a
certain bitterness ' (Wickham). Of. Eccl. xi. 9 ‘ ReJ'oice‚ Ο young man, in thy

wine. ‘he will ᾢ10110115ᾒἶ Υΐὲῐι 1113 ΡΞΞῙΞ stain the pavement.’ At the same
time superbus may be applied to the e rosels, as we speak of a ‘generous ’
wine. The phrase tiuyuot pavimentum implies that the banquet was
riotous and reckless, much wine being spilt. 28. pontificum potiore
cenis, ‘ superior to that of priestly banquets 'z for the use of comparatio
compendiaria, see 2. 6. 14. The· pontifices (see Dict. of Ant.) formed one of
the colleyia 01· ‘guilds ' at Rome, and, as such bodies often do, owed their chief
reputatiou to the splendour of their banquets ; cf. 1. 37. 2 Saliaribus dapibus.

ODE XV

‘ Soon little land will be left for ayriculture, ancl haye villas 'avith their
fiskponds‚ shrubberies, and yar-olens will take ilie place of vineyards aad olive·
yards. Far different were the principles of our ancesiors, of Romulus and
ruqqed Caio ,· iri their days individuals were poor, the commonwealth rich,
private dwellinys modest, the public dwellinys and temples alone magnificent)

The Ode was probably written at the request of Augustus, who about 28 Rc.
having accepted the functions of the censorship‚ made strenuous endeavours
by legislative enactments to restore the rapidly fading virtues of early Rome
(Merivale‚ c. 33), and naturally applied to Horace, as to a sort of Poet
Laureate, in the hope that his verses might excite popular enthusiasm for his
