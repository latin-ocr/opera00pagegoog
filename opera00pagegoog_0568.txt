540 HORACE BOOK 1

ἔφη, ἐστὶ ποιητοῦ· (ικαὶ ’γὰρ ἐν βακχεύμασιν οῧσ’ ἥ ’γε σώφρων οὐ διαφθαρήσεται.”
The quotations are from Euripides, Bacchae 836, and 317, 318.

33. res gerere: there is a general reference here to the successes of
Augustus, but probably no direct allusion to his triumph of 29 B.c. 34.
caelestia temptat, ue. is the way to scale the sky: cf. Od. 3. 2,. 21. 36.
11011 cuivis, etc., ‘it is not the lot of every one to be able to visit Corinth,'
i.e. every one has not the means to indulge in the pleasures provided so
abundantly, but at so high a price, at Corinth. According to the testimony
of Gellius (1. 8. 4), Strabo (8. 6. 20), and othere, the proverb οὐ παντὸς ἀνδρὸς
ές Κόρινθον ἔσθ’ ὁ πλοῦς originated in the exorbitant demands made by

Lais and other courtesans of the place, 011 those who sought their favours. ·

But the context shows that this origin had been almost if not entirely for-
gotten, or Horace could not have used it thus of the pn'zes due to pre-eminent
virtue. The old notion that continqere was only used of good fortune has

long been discarded. Of. note on Cic. Cat. 1. 7. 16; Mayor on Phil. 2. 7. 17.

37. sedit, ‘ renounces the attempt’ 3 like καθῆσθαι of remaining inactive ε cf.
Ter. Ad. 4. 5. 38 an sedere oportuit domi tam gyrandem viryinem, where Donatus
remarks ‘sedere proprie ignavae cessationis est ' : Virg. G. 3. 456 meliora deos
sedet omnia poscenS. The perfects are ‘gnomic' ; cf. 1. 2. 48 11,, A. P. 343.
non succederet, impersonally ‘ things should not go well with him ' ; cf. Ter.
Andr. 4.- 1. 46 hac non successit ; alia adqrediemur via. Sometimes succedo has
res, or inceptum, but never like our ‘succeed' a person as the nominative.
esto, ‘very good’ : cf. 1. 81 n. 38. fecitne-:nonne fecit, as so often in
Plautus and Terence. 39. hic, i.e. in the answer which we give to this
question. 42. recte petit, ‘is right in secking! experiens, ‘ enter-
prising ' 2 Cic. pro Cluent. 8. 23 A. Aurius vir sortis et experiens .· in Verr. 11.
3. 21. 53 homo navus et industrius, experientissimus (ac diliyentissimus) arator.

43-62. One who is payinq court to a creat man should abstain from (1)
direct beyyiny (43-,51) and more indirect attempta to extract money (52-62), or
real causes of complaint zoill not meet with attention. 43. sua has far less
authority than suo, but it certainly gives more point to say ‘ those who say
nothing before a patron of their own poverty.’ The great probability that sua
would be assimilated to reye by transcribere, influenced, it may be, by the
caesura, outweighs the MS. evidence. 45. atqui, etc., ‘but this was the
main point, this the source of yo'ur conduct 'z erat, referring back to lines
11, 12 ‘this was the point which we had in view,’ viZ. to get as much as pos-
sible out of your patron. 46. indotata: to allow a sister to marry with-
out a proper dowry, was regarded as a great disgrace ; cf. Plaut. Trin. 3. 2. 55.
47. nec vendibilis, ‘not saleable,' ie. I can find no purchaser for it.
pascere firmus: Od. 1. >3. 25 11. firmus, ‘safe,' ‘trustworthy.’ 48.
succinit, ‘ chimes in,’ like another of a troop of beggars, joining in the cry.

49. findetur . . . ‘ the cake will be divided, and the gift parted between
you.’ Horace means ‘if you beg so shamelessly, you will attract other beggars
who will clamour for their portion, and so you will have to share with them
what otherwise you might have kept all to yourself.’ Some make the whole
line the cry of 'the second beggar, but if so the fut. findetur must be taken as
:an imperative, and this is too strong for a beggar, however impudent.
quadra: cf. Virg. Aen. 7. 115 ; Juv. 5. 2; Athen. 3. 114 c ἄρτους . . . οὓς
Ῥωμαῖοι κοδράτους λέγουσιν. They were probably scored with a cross so as
to be easily divided. 50. corvus ε the reference cannot be to the familiar

fable of the crow and the fox- (Phaedr. 1. 13 ; Babr. 77), as in it there is no
