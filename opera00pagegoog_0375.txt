ODE XII

‘ Winter is passim away and spriuy returuiuss, the swallow is buildiny her
nest and the Shepherds are pipiuy ou the yrass. The warmer weather suyyests
a drinkiuy party, but ff you, Veryilz'us, who have so many ‘noble youths amony
your patrona, mean to driulc my best aeine, why then you must “ pay your
shot’' with a box of uara aud theu you shall have the best tha-t is to be pro-
cured. Come then and bm‘uy the nard .· Ι cannot affo‘rd to feast you wholly
at my oum eost .· come quiclcly and fao-yet money-making] for a while: lffe is
short, remember, and a little folly iu its seasou is very pleasant.'

The Vergilius here addressed is certainly not the poet, for (1) he died
B.c. 19, before this Book was published‚ (2) the language here used (iuvenum
nobilium cliens 15, studium lucri 25) could not possibly have been applied to
him3 cf. the language used 1. 3. 6 ; S. 1. 5. 40 ; 1. 6. 55.

1. veris comites. These ‘attendants of spring' are not the Zephyrs as
in 4. 7. 9, but the ‘northern breezes ⁹ mentioned in line 2. So Columella 11.
2. 21 oe. Cal. M art. venti Septentrioualoe, qui vocantur Oruitlw'ae, per dies
triqiuta esse solent ,· tum et hirundo advenit. 2. Thraciae, ‘ northern' 3 ef.
1. 25. 11 ; Epod. 13. 3. 4. hiberna nive turgidi, ‘swollen with winter’s
snow,' i.e. with the melting of it. This would take place in very early spring
before settled warm weather came in. 5. Ityn . . . ‘the unhappy bird
that ever mournfully means for Itys and (is) the undying disgraee of the
house of Cecrops for that she cruelly avenged . . .' Cf. Soph. El. 148 ἃ
Ἴτυν, αἰὲν Ἴτυν ὀλοφύρεται Ι ὄρνις ἀτυζομένα, Διὸς ἄγγελος, of the swallow. ,
8. regum. The plural is generic: the reference is to Tereus alone, but
the plural suggests that such vicious acts were common among princes. For
the story, see Diet. Ant. s.v. Tereus : some legends make Procne (the swallow)
mother of Itys, others Philomela (the nightingale). Here in connexion with
nest-building as a sign of spring the swallow seems referred to, ef. Virg. G. 4.
306 aute Ι garrula quam tiquis nidum suspendat hirundo: ‘ before spring‚'
and the proverb μία χελιδὼν ἔαρ οὐ ποιεῖ.

9. dicunt carmina fistula, ‘rehearse songs with the pipe,' i. e. with the
assistance of the pipe. fistula is a Pan's-pipe (σύριγξ), and deum, cui . . .
refers to Pan. 11. nigri, ‘ dark-wooded.' 14. sed. pressum . . .
‘but if you are eager to quaff wine pressed at Cales' (cf. 1. 20. 9 n.).
ducere: 1. 17. 22 n. 16. merebere, ‘ you wilL' ue. ‘must earn?

17. nardi parvus onyx: onyx, so called from its resemblance to the
finger-nail (ὄνυξ), is a kind of marble or alabaster: it was frequently used in
making boxes for ointments or unguente, and hence the word is frequently
used: ⁶ an ointment box ' of whatever material, ay. Prop. 3. 10. 22 murreus
onyx. Cf. the accounts given of the anointing of Christ at Bethany: St.
Matthew (xxvi. 7) speaks of ἀλάβαστρον μύρου βαρυτίμου; St. Mark (xiv. 3),
with his usual accuracy, has ἀλ. μύρου νάρδου πιστικῆς πολυτελοῦς, adding
that she ‘ brake the box ’ (συντρίψασα), and that its value was ἐπάνω τριακοσίων
δηναρίων. eliciet, ‘shall lure forth! 18. Sulpiciis . . . ‘reposes in
the Sulpician stores! For proper nouus used as adJeotives, see 1. 15. 10 n.
The ‘Sulpician’ stores were on the Tiber at the foot of the Aventine and
subsequently became part of the imperial domain, being well known as the
