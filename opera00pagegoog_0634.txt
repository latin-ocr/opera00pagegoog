says (Poet.18.19) καὶ τὸν χορὸν δὲ’ ένα δεῖ ὑπολαβεῖν τῶν ὑποκριτῶν καὶ μόριον
εἶναι τοῦ ὅλου καὶ συναγωνίζεσθαι, μὴ ὥσπερ παρ’ Εὐριπίδῃ ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ παρὰ
Σοφοκλει. Ι11 Seneca' s tragedies the choruses are quite unconnected with the
plot. 194. intercinat followed by the accusative without a preposition
as in Od. 1. 14. 19 interfusa nitentes aequora Cyclada& Phis construction of
a compound verb becomes very common in Tacitus: ay. Ann. 2. 9 flumen
Visuryis Romanos Cheruscosque interfluebat ,· 3. 23 qui coqnitionem intervenc-
rant. 196. bonis faveat : the chorus almost invariably expresses the view
of right-minded spectators. 197. amet peccare timentes is the reading
of almost all MSS. Bentley objected to it as otiose afterfaveat boni& suggesting
pacare tumentes which is certainly otiose after reyat iratos. Kiessling, with
very slight authority, reads pacare timcntcc‘, ‘to calm the timorous‚’ but the
phrase is a very strange one. 198. mensae brevis, i.e. of a table on which
there is a cena brevis Ep. 1. 14. 35. salubrem iustitiam, ‘ the blessings
of Justice! 199. apertis portis: cf. Od. 3. 5. 23 portasque non clausas,
200. tegat commissa: as in Soph. Electr. 469 ; Philoct. 3913 Eur. Hippol.
712 ; Elect. 271, etc.

202·2l9. The music, which accompanied the choruS, underwcnt yreat
chanyes as Zumury increased, and the Zanyuaye of the chorus became more
ornate. 202. tibia: see illustrations etc. in Dict. Ant. orichalco:
a kind of yellow copper 01· natural brass quod praecipuam bonitatem admiratio-

· nemque diu obtinuit nec reperitur Zonqo iam tempore effeta tellure (Plin. H. N.

34. 2. 2). The Greeks called it ὀρείχαλκος (Hes. Scut. 122): the word is
common in Plautus in the form aurichalcum (0.9. Cure. l. 3. 46) and seems to
be used vaguely for a precious metal, though in Curc. l. c. it is distinguished
from aurum. Virg. Aen. 12. 87 has alboque orichalco, where the force of the
epithet is doubtful: cf. Conington ad loc. Cic. de Off. 3. 23. 92 speaks of
it as only worth one-thousandth part of the value of gold. tubaeque
aemula: the lengthening of the tibia by means of the brass vincturae would
tend to make it as powerful as a trumpet. 203. tenuis of sound‘ thin,
weakss foramine: Varro ait . . . quattuor foraminum fuisse tibias
apud antiquos, et se ipsum ait in templo Marsyae vidisse tibias quattuor sora-
minum. quare quaterna tantum foramina antiquae tibiae habuerunt: alii
dicunt, non plus quam tria—Acron. The tibiae pares 111 the British Museum
(found at Athens) are about 15 inches long, and have five holes at the top and
one underneath. pauco : very rare in the singular ι but Gen. 20. 1. 31
has iniurias factas XXV assibus sanxerunt. non omnino omnes iniurias aere
isto pauco diluerunt ,· Bell. Afric. 67. 2 pauco tritici numero ,· Vitruv. l. l. 6
paucum manum. The parvo of some MSS. is clearly a correction. 204.
adspirare=ovvavxe2v ‘to give the note to. ' adesse, ⁶ accompauy. ' 206.
quo :in quac. numerabilis, ‘easily counted’ :Horace was the first to
use the word, which is probably derived from the· similar use of εὐαρίθμητοςι

{fi 13Τ11εὲ001κ 16. 87 ἀριθματοὺς ἀπὸ πολλῶν. sane not with numerabilis,

208. urbes: Schiitz reads-urbem, arguing that the reference can only be
to Rome, as in the preceding lines. But there is no reason to doubt that
Greece, and especially Athens, was in the mind of Horace quite as much as
Rome, if not more so, for there was apparently no great change in the music
or diction of the chorus at Rome. 209. latior: not of course actually
‘thicker‚’ but with amplecti, ‘ to ensold in a broader circuit.' diurno ε to

drink wine by day was regarded as excessive sels· indulgence in earlier
