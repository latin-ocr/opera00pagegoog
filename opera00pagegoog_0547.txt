give ad celera, the grammatical correction of a copyist, who did not see the

construction of cetera ‘as to all other thingS,' as below in line 50 ; cf. Od. 4.

2. 60; Virg. Aen. 3. 594 at cetera Graius. Translate ‘A lover of the country, ,
Ι send my greeting to Fuscus, a lover of the city. In this 0116 matter, to be

sure, much unlike, but in all else all but twins, with the hearts of brothers ς

whatever one denies, the other denies too, and we assent alike ε we are like a

pair of pigeons long attached and well known to each other, but you keep

your nest, I praise ' etc. The punctuation of the lines is however very un-

certain (see wilkins). Kriiger and Kiessling give yemelli fraternis animis

(quidquid myat alter el alter) adnuimus pariter, vetuli uotique columbi. tu‘
nidum . . . thus bringing adnuimus into close ,connexion with columbi in

reference to the well-known ‘billing' (columbari) of doves. 5. vetuli:

Fuscus appears intimate with Horace 111 S. 1. 9, 116. about fifteen years before

this Epistle. 7. circumlita, ‘overspread ' z the word suggests the smooth

softness of the moss.

8. quid quaeris? ‘in short ’ : 6 very common phrase, especially in
Cicero’s letters, when a writer drops details and makes a general statement.
regno, ⁴ I feel myselfa king.' 9. effertis ε 100 strongly supported to allow
us to reject it as simply a gloss on seriis of many MSS. Cf. Cic. ad Fam. 9.
14. 1 te summis laudibus ad caelum eaeticleruut. rumore secundo, ‘ with
loud applause‚' lit. ‘with approving cries.' 'Phe phrase seems to have been a
poetical common-place, being found in Ennius (Ann. 7) populi memore secundo,-
an old poet in Cic. de Div. 1. 16. ⁶29 solvere imperat secundo rumore adversaque
avi,· Virg. Aen. 8. 90 ,‘ Tac. Ann. 3. 29. 10. liba, ‘cakes ' made of flour
and milk or 011 (Athen. 3. 125 πλακοῦς ἐκ γάλακτος ἰτρίων τε καὶ μέλιτος ὃν
Ῥωμαῖοι λίβον καλοῦσι), and often spread with honey. Cato de R. R. 75
directs that they should be made of pounded cheese, fine flour, and an egg.
For the placenta (which is here identical with the libum) he gives much more
elaborate directions in c. 76. placenta is a curious instance of a Greek loan-
word (πλακόεντα 600.) transformed by popular etymology (=quool placei) at
an early stage: libum is identical with our loaf, and has lost an initial 0, as
that has lost an h (A. S. Illas). The priest’s slave ran away, because he was
tired of being fed 011 1116 sacrificial cakes.

waler so pure. 12. naturae convenienter, i.e. if we are to take the rule
of the Stoics as om· guide, which makes it the summum bouum ὁμολογουμένως
τῇ φύσει ζῆνε 11113 Cicero (de Off. 3. 3. 13) explains to mean cum virtute cou-
9ruere semper, celera autem, quae secuudum naturam esseut, ita lasere, si ea
virtuli nou repuqnareul. But probably Horace used the phrase in a looser
fashion. 13. ponendaeque domo: the thought is compressed, and, if
expanded, would run somewhat 111113, ‘and if the first thing to be done is to
choose the suitable sphere, as you would first choose the site if you were
buildiug a house! 15. tepeant: of course the winters are not milder in
the country than in town; but Horace is thinking of 1113 own country-house,
sheltered by hills from the colder winds. 16. rabiem Canis: the dog-
star rises 011 July 20th, but becomes visible only on July 26111. The sun
enters the constellation Leo on J uly 23rd. momenta: perhaps best taken
as in l. 6. 4 of ‘motions,' i.e. the celestial movements which bring the Sun
near to the Lion, which 1113 keen rays are represented as stinging into a fury,
