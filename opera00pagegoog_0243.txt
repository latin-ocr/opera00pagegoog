ODE XIV

‘ Take need, Ο ship, lest you ‘27⁹2st out to sea again. Observe how skattered
you already are by stoma-3, and hasten eayerly into harbour and stay there!

The ship is the State (cf. Aesch. Theb. 1 and see Dict. s.v. quomo), which is
spoken of as shattered by the storms of civil war, and in danger of drifting
back into the same dangerous waters, and the Ode may well refer to any of
the early years of the sole rule of Augustus. Quintilian, 8. 6. 44, mentions
this Ode as an instance of Ἀλληγορία quae aliud verbis atiud sensu ostendit
. . . navem Horatius pro re publica, fluctuum tempestates pro bellis civilibus,
portum pro pace et concordia dicit. It is copied from Alcaeus, and part of the
, original is preserved in Heraclides' Roma-ic Alleyories .·
ἀσυνέτημι τῶν ἀνέμων στάσιν· χείμωνι μοχθεῦντες μεγάλῳ μάλα·
τὸ μὲν ’γὰρ ἔνθεν κῦμα κυλίνδεται, περ μὲν ’γὰρ ἄντλος ἰστοπέδαν ἔχει,

τὸ δ’ ἔνθεν· ἄμμες δ’ ἀν τὸ μέσσον λαῖφος δὲ πᾶν ζάδηλον ἤδη
νᾶζ φορεύμεθα σὺν μελαίνᾳ, καὶ λάκιδες μέγαλαι κατ’ αὖτο.

2. fortiter occupa portum, ‘stoutly make for harbour (before it is
too late).' For occupo ef. Gk. use of φθάνειν with a part„ and 2. 12. 28
rapere occupa, ‘is the first to snatch.' 3. nonne vides . . . ⁴ mark
you not how the side is stripped of oars, and (how) the mast damaged by the
swift Afric wind and the yard-arms groan . . . ‘2’ It is better to understand
sit after nudum, than with Orelli to make latus, matus and antemnae all
nominatives to yemant. For the zeugma in vides ut . . . gemant cf.
3. 10. 5 n. 6. αηῦθωηεε-ἀνατεινομένη, From words such as this we
infer that the pres. part. in μενος was common originally to both Latin and
Greek ; cf. Vertumnus, alumnus, and 3. 18. 4 n. funibus: cf. Acts xxvii.
17 βοηθείαις ἐχρῶντο ὑποζωννύντες τὸ πλοῖον, ‘undergirding the ship ' 3 L. and
S. s.v. ὑπόζωμα. Ropes.seem to have been passed under the keel and drawn
tight to prevent the timbers starting. The word cannot: ‘ anchor-cables ’ for
the ship is at sea. 7. carinae. The plural is rare: perhaps the poet is
thinking of the two sides of the keel which the ropes would hold together.
8. imperiosius, ‘too tyrannous.' The very size of the word is expressive.

10. di . . . cf. Ov. Her. 16. 112 accipit et pictos puppis adunca deos-,-
Virg. Aen. 10. 171 aurato fulgebat Apolline puppis ,· PerS. 6. 30 iacet ‘cjpse
in littore et una Ι inqentes de puppe dei. Figures of gods were placed in the
stern as tutelary deities of the ship. 11. Pontica pinus. The forests of
Pontus afforded ample material for ship-building. 13. nomen inutile.
The reputation of Pontic timber would be of no avail to the ship in storm;
so, the reputation derived from early history would be of no avail to Rome
amid the billows of civil strife. 14. pictis. Emphatic : no empty decora-
tion can afford confidence in danger. 15. tu . . . ‘ do thou take heed,
unless thou art destined to be the sport of the winds.' debere ludibrium,
‘ to owe a laughing-stock,'=7e‘)lma ὀφλισκάνειν.

17. nuper, οἱα. during the actual occurrence of the civil wars. 18.
nunc, πλε. now that they are over and threaten to revive. desiderium,
‘obJ‘ect of my yearning' or ‘affection,' cf. Cic. Fam. 14. 2. 2 mea lux, meum
desiderium. 19. nitentes. cf. 3. 28. 14 sulyentes Cycladas. The
epithet alludes to the effect produced by the sun glistening on their marble
rocks. Cf. Byron: ‘The isles of Greece, the isles of Greece! . .· . Eternal
summer gilde them yet, Ι But all, except their sun, is set.' 20. cycladas,
From κύκλος, because they were in a ‘ circle ' round Delos.
