440 Α HORACE BOOK 11

qora‘n Pythaqo‘reosque numquam dubitasse quin ex universa mente divina
aniwws delibatos haberemus; Virg. 6. 746 seq. ; Cic. Tusc. 5. 13. 38 humanus
animus, decerptus ex mente divina ,· M. Aurelius 12. 26 ὁ ἑκάστου νοῦς θεός;
2. 4 ἀπόρροια θεοῦε 5. 27 ἀπόσπασμα θεοῦ.

80. alter, ‘the other‚’ i. e. the man of spare diet. dicto citius belongs
both to curata and sopori dedit. The light meal is quickly despatched : sleep
comes as soon as courted. 84. tenuatum, by poor living ; cf. Tac. Ann.
15. 63 senile corpus et parvo victa tenuatum. ubique--et abi, ‘ and when.'
85. Palmer inserts et before tractari. 86. quidnam accedet . . . Of.
Cels. 1. 1 fin. cavendum ne in secanda valetudine adversae praesidia consumantur.

89. rancidum, ‘high’ non quia . . . erat: Kennedy‚ Pub. Sch.
Grammar p. 460, says of ‘non qaia with indicative: ‘If the cause denied
is one which is not conceivable, non quod, non qaia take the indicative ’ ; and
he quotes this passage, and Livy 10. 41 aon qaia plus animi victis est. The
Ciceronian rule‚ however, seems 1ο be that non quia is used with ind. when a

real fact is stated, the application of which is denied in the case considered: .

Plane. 32. 68 non qaia multis debeo. Later writers, however, used non quia of
false reasons ε Livy 33. 27 ‘non quia satis dz’ynos eos credebat ,· Tac. Hist. 3. 4
non qaia industria Flaviani efflabat. There is no inconceivability in these
two passages. According to the Ciceronian rule‚ the words of Horace here
would imply that the ancients had no uoses. 91. tardius ι when st was
too late to kill and prepare anything. vitiatum, ‘turned’ 92. 111-
teg-rum, ‘fresh‚’ opp. vitiatum. 93. heroas, ‘heroes‚' as being able to
sace such gastronomic terrors, tellus prima: ‘the primal earth ' is always
supposed to have produced men of heroic mould, true γηγενεῖς. 89-93.
Palmer (see his Crit. Notes) holds these lines spurious, but whatever in them
is illogical may be defended on the ground that Horace is obviously joking.

94. das aliquid famae, ‘you 361 some store by good report, in that it
(qaaezquippe quae) enthralls 13116 ears more grateful than song.' 95. oc-
cupet has much more authority than occupat. Porph. here tells of Antisthenes
the following story: is enim cum mdisset adolescentem Zuaeuriosum Acro-
amatibas deditum, ait, miseram 16, adolescens, qui numquam audisti summum
acroama, laudem tuam. Cf. Plin. Ep. 7. 32 est enim, at Xenophon ait, ἥδιστον
ἄκουσμα ἔπαινος. grandes . . . grande: the same epithet is purposely
repeated. 97. patruum: the uncle, the type of severe respectability3
cf. Od. 3. 12. 3. vicinos z sc. iratos. 99. as, ‘a penny to buy a rope '
to hang yourself ; cf. Lucian, Tim. 20 ἐγὼ δέ τοι πολλοὺς ἂν εἰπεῖν ἔχοιμί σοι
χθὲς μὲν οὐδὲ ὀβολὸν ὥστε πρίασθαι βρόχον ἐσχηκότας ἄφνω δὲ τήμερον
πλουσίους; Plaut. Pseud. 1. 1. 86 Ps. sed qaid de drachma facere vis? Ca.
restim volo mihi emere. Some MSS. give aee. inquit: sc. quispiam, cf.
1. 4. 79. Transius: some penniless bankrupt.

102. quod superat ε accusative after insumere. Can you not find a better
use for your superfluous wealth 2 103. indignus : sc. qai eyeat ,· cf. Plaut.
Cure. 4. 2. 27 indifflzis si male dicitur, male dictam id esse dico,· Arist. Nub.
525 ἡττηθεὶς οὐκ ἄξιος ὥν. 104. templa ruunt . . . Of. od. 3. 6. 1.
106. nimirum: ironical, ‘you will of course prove the one exception to the
general rule, that change and disaster is the lot of men! - 107. risus,
γέλως, a laughing-stock, as you will very likely be one day, when you are left
penniless. uterne: -30 quone 2. 3. 295 ; quantam 2. 3. 317. ne is pleonastic.
108. ad casus dubios, ‘against the changes and chauces of life.' 109.
adsuerit: transitive, like insuevit. 1. 4. 105. superbum belongs both
