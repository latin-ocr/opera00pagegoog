320 HORACE BOOK 111

has become her loathing‚ hence the cynical scorn with which she speaks of it,
and the use of such terms as tenera and sucus (J'uice) with reference to it,
terms which are applicable to butcher’s meat. Cf. pascere. 57. pater
urguet absens, ‘ so my father far away assails me.’ 58. potes. Em-
phatic: you have the power, use it. 59. bene: ironically=‘happily,’
cf. delectant. 60. laedere, ‘break’

, 61. rupes et acuta leto saxa, ‘ precipices and rocks sharp for death.’
The saxa are rocks and boulders lying at the foot of the precipiceS‚ rough and
jagged‚ and therefore sure to cause death. 62. age te . . . ‘quick‚ trust
thyself to the rushing wind.' 63. erile pensum, ‘a task done for a
mistress,' ‘ a bondmaid’s task.’ pensum, from pendo to weigh, is the portion
of wool weiyhed out as the work for a certain period. 64. carpere: ‘ pluck ’
or draw out the wool into long threads, which were then wound round the
spindle ready for weaving‚ see Dict. Ant. S. v. Fusus. 65. regius sanguis,
‘ the daughter of kings,' in strong opposition to erile pensum and dominae.
sanguis: 2. 20. 5 n. tradi, i.e. to be abandoned by her paramour and
handed over to the mercy of his injured and incensed wife. paelex: 3. 10. 15 n.

66. aderat . . . The abrupt transition from Europa’s speech to narra-
tive, and the marked prominence of the verb, express the suddenness of the
appearance of the goddeSS‚ who at the critical moment intervenes with
dramatic effect. ‘ Lo ! at her side thus wailing stood Venus with a mocking
smile.’ 6'7. perfidum: neut. adj. used adverbially‚ cf. 1. 22. 23 n.
remisso : symbolical of his peaceful purpose.

69. lusit, i. e. amused herself with laughing at her. abstineto
irarum: 2. 9. 17 11. 71. cum tibi . . . ‘when the hateful bull shall
bring you back his horns to tear? Venus mockingly repeats the very word
(lacerare, line 46) used by Europa. 73. uxor . . . esse nescis, ‘thou
knowest not how to be the bride,' ae. what befits the bride3 this rendering
harmonises with disce below, ‘you are as yet ignorant how to play your part,
learn to do sc.' Others take uxor as=ux0rem in imitation of Gk. idiom (cf.
Ep. 1. 7. 22 n.), ‘Thou knowest not that thou art the bride.' 75. tua . . .
‘ half the globe shall take thy name.’

ODE XXVIII

An invitation to Lyde to join him in celebrating the Neptunalia, a festival
held on J uly 23rd. ’

1. festo . . . The question is a retort to a supposed obJ'ection: ‘What
better could I do 2 Produce the wine.' 2. reconditum, ‘ stored far ba0k‚’
old3 cf. 2. 3. 8 interior nota3 Epod. 9. 1 repostum Caecubum. 3. strenua ,
with prome, ‘produce and briskly.' Horace humorously makes Lyde act
as butler. Kiessling, however, supposes the scene in Lyde's house, into
which, as he is strolling about, Horace turns with the words festo . . . die.
4. munitaeque . . . ‘ and assault the fortress of philosophy.' Philosophy
is represented as possessing a fortress inaccessible and impregnable to tempta-
tion: cf. Lucr. 2. 7 bene quam munita tenere Ι edita doctrina sapientum
templa ser-enm Arist. Nub. 1024 ὦ καλλίπυργον σοφίαν . . . ἐπασκῶν and
Tennyson's Palace of Art, stanzas 1-4.

5. inclinare meridiem, ‘ that noon declineS‚' τῖε. that the sun has passed
the zenith. Of. Livy 9. 32 sol meridie se inclinavit. meridies=medidies
(midday)‚ altered for the sake of euphony. 6. stet, ⁴ stood still,’ halted in
