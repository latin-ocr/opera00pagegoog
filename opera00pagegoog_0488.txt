signa means ‘ to commit to writing‚’ taking siqua for the letterS, the symbols
of things z cf. Plaut. Eud. 5. 1. 14 longis litteris siquabo. Orelli and Kiessling,
however, explain siqua of shorthand symbols. vincunt Pythagoran:
‘surpass P.' i.e. the precepts of Pythagoras, cf. line 16 11. 3. Anytique reum.
Socrates: histhree accusers were Meletus, AnthS‚ Lycon. 4. peccatum: noun,
⁴ I confess my fault.' sio : not to be joined with laevo, but with interpellarim t
‘in that I have accosted you as I have done, at an inauspicious moment.’
tempore laevo: opp. t. dextro 2. 1. 19. 5. bonus,'‘of your grace'
or ‘goodness-’3 with mock respect. The mock seriousness throughout should
be noticed carefully. 6. interciderit, ‘shall have slipped from your memory.' ,
7. hoc : this faculty of reminiscence. artis refers to artificial memory, the
invention of which was ascribed to the lyric poet Simonides of Ceos, Cic. de
Orat. 2. 86. 351 ; Quint. 11. 2. 11 3 Auct. ad Herenn. 3. 16 suut duae
memoriae, uua naturalia altera artificiosa etc. 9. tenues ; '‘ subtle,’cf. line 36.

11. canam, ‘recite,’ a word applied to oracles and epic poetry: it is
. selected by Catius as in keeping both with the mystery and dignity of his
subJ‘ect: see 1. 9. 30. 12. As Comm. Cruq. remarks, beue ab ovis incipit,
i.e. ab initio cenae ut alibi (1. 3. 7) ab ovo usque ad mala citaret io Bacche.
Long-shaped eggs had better flavour (qratioris saporiS, as Pliny, H. N. 10. 74,
explained suci melioris). 13. magis alba, ‘ whiter,’ i.e. whiter inside, referring>
both-to the white and yolk of the egg. The white was a purer white, and the
yolk a paler red. Cf. Plin. H. N. 10. 74. 144, where the contrary is stated of the
eggs of water-fowl z aquaticis lutei plus quam albi, idque ipsum mayis luridum
quam ceteris. Others understand alba to refer only to the white of the egg,
which is here said to be whiter in long-shaped eggs. 14. ponere: serve
up, 2. 2. 23. namque marem cohibent callosa vitellum, ‘for they
are compact, and enclose a male yolk.' That oval eggs were more likely to
produce cocks than round ones is stated by Columella, 8. 5. 11 3 Pliny, H.
N. 10. 74. 145 3 but the opposite is laid down by Aristotle, H. N. 6. 2. 2.

15. cole: caule, ‘ cabbage,' is much the better attested form here. Cf. caupo
and copo, plaustrum and plostrum, plaudo and plodO, cauda and coda, claudo
and clodo, Gaurus and Corus, raudus and rodus, si audes and sodes, fauces and
suffoco, focalia. In most of these cases the form with ο was the more vulgar
one. suburbano ε 11111011 of the land close to Rome was flat and marshy.
It is generally taken to refer to the artificial watering of the rich men’s gardens
near Rome. 16. elutius, ‘insipid,' lit.-washed out. inriguo horte,
a compendious comparative for ‘than the cabbage of a well-watered garden.’

17. oppresserit, ‘ drops in on you ' ι opprimere is generally to come upon
by surprise. Juv. 10. 75 si oppressa foret. secura senectus Ι principis, ‘ if the
old emperor had been caught off his guard. ' 18. malum responset, ⁶ off er
an unkind resistance to, ' responsare always means ‘ resist,' ⁶ defy,’ in Horace,
cf. 2. 7. 85, 103; Ep. 1. 1. 68. malum is used adverbially, cf. Od. 1. 22.
23 11. 19. doctus eris t notzdocebere, as Orelli, but ‘ you will show
your science by plunging it living into Falernian must.' doctus is adj., and
the construction is the same as 2. 8. 24 ridiculus absorbere ‚· 2. 7. 85f0rtis respou-
sare. musto Falerno, Bentley’s nearly certain emendation for mixto of the
MSS. Must, i. e. the unfermented juice of the grape, was kept for a year, and
was used in cookery: Cato R. R. 120 ; Colum. 12. 29. Of course it would be
very much cheaper than old wine. mersare: according to Bentley, this
means to kill by drowning : he quotes Cic. Mur. 29. 61 uec ‘miuus delinquere
