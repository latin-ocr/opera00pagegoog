ODE XVII

to have received their name from that old Icinq who founded Formiae), 'to-
morrow the raven predicis we shall have a storm, so yet in some εἰη] wood at
once and make ready for enjoyiny the day in the house!

L. Aelius Lamia was consul ΑΛ). 3, praefectus urbi ΑΛ). 32, and 1. 26 is
also addressed to him3 see also 1. 36. 7 ; Ep. 1. 14. 6. No doubt the Lamiae
laid claim to a descent from the Lamus mentioned by Homer, Od. 10. 81
ἑβδομάτῃ δ’ ἱκόμεσθα Λάμου αἰπὺ πτολίεθρον Ι Τηλέπυλον Λαιστρυγονίην, such
claims to heroic ancestry being common (cf. the alleged descent of the 96913
Iulia from Iulus, and 566 Virg. Aen. 5. 117-123), and Juvenal 4. 154 (hoc
nocuit Lamiarum caede madenti) speaks of them as typica] aristocratS. The
long parenthesis therefore (lines 2-9) referring to the birth of Lamia seems
perfectly natural, especially in an Ode which is purely complimentary, the rest
of it merely supplying an imaginary reason for addressing Lamia at all.

2. hinc: a Lamo, ‘from him'3 so unde frequentlyz‘from whom';
cf. 1. 12. 17. et priores . . . et nepotum: priores refers to the pre-
historic Lamiae whose existence would have to be inferi-ed to fill up the gap
between Lamus and the first of their descendants (nepotum) whose name was
to be found in ‘historic records ’ (memores fastos): priores therefore: ‘the
earlier.' fasti (4. 14. 4 n.) would apply either to public or private records
such as genealogies and the like. 5. ducis. So all MSS. The emendation
ducit, the stop after fastos being removed and yenus becoming the nom. before
ducit, would make the sentence smoother, the sudden change to direct personal
address in ducis in the middle of the parenthesis being very harsh, and the
sense, ‘ since your ancestors sprung from Lamus, you are descended from the
founder of Formiae,' none of the best. Schutz strikes out lines 2-5.
ducis, ‘ derive ' : the word is strictly used of drawing out a thread, here of
drawing out his line of ancestry.

7. et innantem . . . ‘and ‚to have possessed the Liris where it floats
amid the coasts of Marica, lords of a broad domain.' The Lin‘s (Garigliano)
flows into the sea through the marshes of Minturnae; it is to these marshes
that Horace refers as Maricae litora, Marica being a local goddess, and the Liris
being admirably described 65 ‘ floating amid them ' because of its slow lazy
movement through the level marshy district3 cf. 1. 31. 7. 9. late
tyrannus. An adverb may qualify a noun when the noun 1165, 65 here, a
strong verbal forcez‘widely ruling.' cf. Ep. 2. 2. 167 emptor quondam3
Virg. Aen. 1. 21 populum late reyem. 10. inutili. Added to make clearer
the contrast between the cheerlessness out of doors and the good cheer within.
vilior αΖ9α was proverbial, cf. S. 2. 5. 8 ; Virg. Ecl. 7. 42. 12. augur: as
giving an ‘ augury ’ of bad weather, cf. 3. 27. 10 n.

13. annosa: according to a fragment of Hesiod, ἐννέα τοι ζώει ’γενεὰς λακέ-
ρυζα κορώνη Ι ἀνδρῶν ἡβώντων ; cf. 4. 13. 25 cornicis vetulae. 14. Genium
mero curabis: ‘ you shall refresh (or ‘cheer ²) your soul with wine.' Such
phrases as se, se ipsam, corpus, cutem Ep. 1. 2. 29, pelliculam curare S. 2. 5. 38,
are common, and imply ‘taking considerable or special care of ' the thing
mentioned, especially in the way of procuring enJ'oyment t Horace invent-s the
phrase genium curare on the analogy of these. Genius is a sort of spiritual
alter 690 which is born (cf. qiqno, qenitus) and perishes along with each of
115, and shares all our J'oys and sorrows: cf. Ep. 1. 7. 94 n. ; 2. 2. 187.
