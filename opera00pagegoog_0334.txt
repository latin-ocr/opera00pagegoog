306 HORACE Book 111

cious (divitum) are divided into two ‘ camps ’ or ‘factions ’ (castra, partes),
and Horace says that he means to be ‘ a deserter ' from the one and go ‘ empty·
handed ' 10 1118 other. The metaphor must not be pressed too closely : when
Horace calls himself ‘ a deserter from the rich ' he does not imply that he had
ever been rich. 25. contemptae . . . ‘more proud in the ownership
of a despised farm ’ ; not ‘ despised ’ by him but by the arrogant and wealthy.
splendidior exactly means the same as the slang phrase ‘feeling myself a
greater swell ' 3 cf. splendet, 3. 3. 25. 26. quidquid. arat, ‘whatever (the
Apulian) *ploughs'zthe produce of his plough. For arai cf. S. 1. 5. 90 11.
27. occultare dicerer: not merelyzoccultarem ‘hoarded‚' but: ‘had the
reputation of hoarding ' : he is speaking not merely of a wealthy man but of
one whose wealth is such as to be the subject of general rumour. There is
also an antithesis between the reputation of 1118 111811 and his true condition,
⁶ a beggar in the midst of wealth.' 28. inter opes inops: opes 10 be
taken literally, inops metaphorically‚ ‘ a beggar ' as regards the possession of
that contentment which is alone true riches. For the oxymoron cf. 3. 11. 35.

30. et segetis . . . ‘ (these) and a harvest that never fails its promise
are a happier lot unknown to the brilliant lord of fertile Africa.' sorte:
with a reference to the sors provinciae which has secured the imperium Africae
for the great man. fallit beati0r=7kav6dvec οὖσα ὀλβιωτέρα, ‘escapes his
notice (being) happier ' 3 the non-existence of a present part. of the verb ‘to
be ' makes Latin somewhat less clear in such cases, For segetis fides cf.
3. 1. 30 n. Africa was one of the principa] districts on which Rome relied
forits supplies of corn. 33. Calabrae apes ε for the honey of Tarentum
cf. 2. 6. 14. 34. Laestrygonia. Lamus king of the Laestrygones is
said to have founded Formiae. See next Ode. 35. languescit, ‘grows
mellow! pinguia, ‘ rich‚' ‘thick'

37. inportuna pauperies: certainly not the οὐλομένη πενίη ‘baneful
poverty ' of Hesiod, which Orelli compares: it is contrary to the whole spirit
of the Ode to speak of ‘baneful poverty.’ pauperies (cf. 1. 12. 43 and note)
is not ‘ poverty‚' but ‘ humble circumstances ' 3 when however circumstances
get to be so humble that they are continually causing annoyances and vexations,
then you have inportuna pauperies ‘ the worry of not having enough‚' which
is exactly what H. says he is free from. He would have called himself ‘ poor '
pauper, but with him pauperies was not inportuna. 39. contracto . . .
porrigam. Notice the rhetorical ‚effect of the apparent opposites ε ‘ by
contracting . . . I shall extend.' For the thought cf. the proverb ‘maynurn
veetiqal est parsimonia. 40. vectigalia, ‘revenueS‚’ cf. S. 2. 2. 100 ;
strictly taxes on things carried (vecta), ‘import dutieS.’ 41. quam si . . .
⁶ than if I made Mygdonian plains one unbroken estate with the kingdom of
A.’ continuare is ‘to make continuous ' or ‘ unbroken ' (continuusz ‘ holding
on to each other ⁷) ; hence, when a person makes two adjacent estates into one,
he is said continuare ‘to extend the one with the other.' Of. Livy 34. 4
cupido a9ros continuandi ‘ adding field to field.' Alyattes was father of
Croesus. Horace forms the gen. as from Alyatteiis. Mygdonia was a district
of Asia Minor W. of Bithynia. 43. bene est, cuizbene esi ei, eui ‘well
is it with him to whom Providenoe . . .' On the other hand male (est) 2. 10.
