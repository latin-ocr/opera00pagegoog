23 11. This passage must have been written after 17 B.c. when Horace re·
turned for a while to lyric poetry. prius orto sole, not like the old
RomanS, to give advice to their clients‚ but to begin composing. This is not
inconsistent with ad quartam iaceo of S. 1. 6. 122, for there he is not repre-
sented as sleeping, but as reading and writing in his lectulus. 113. scrinia
are cases of hookS, which he might wish to refer to ; cf. S. 1. 1. 120.

114. habrotonum, ‘ southernwood ² or ‘ Pontio wormwood .' (Munro on
Lucr. 4. 125), is mentioned elsewhere as 8 useful medicine. Plin. 21. 92. 160
usus et foliis (habrotoni), sed maior semini ad excatfaciendum, ideo nervis utile,
tussi, orthopnoeae, convulsiS, ruptis, tumbis, ammae anqustiis. 115. quod
medicorum est: Bentley found fault with the tautology involved in the
mention of physicianS, after habrotonum . . . dare, and suggested melicormn
indici. But micus-2⁴0, musician ’ is very doubtful. 117. indocti
doctique, ‘unskil'led and skilled alike ἐ doctus like σοφός is a common
epithet of a poet ; cf. Od. 1. 1. 29.

imitation is ‘ And rarely Av'rice taints the tuneful 1nind.’ 120. 11011
temere, ‘not lightly'3 2. 2. 13; S. 2. 2. 116; Α. Ρ. 160, zze. ‘seld01n.'
hoc studet 2 this construction of studeo and similar verbs is only found with
neuter pronouns or adjectives like omnia. Roby 1094. 122. 80810,
‘ partner,' Od. 3. 24. 60 ; ef. 018. pro Rosc. Am. 40 in rebus minoribus fallere
socium turpissimum est. Condemnation in an action pro socio involved in-
famia (Gaius 4. 182). incogitat is a ἅπ. λεγ. Horace is fond of new
compounds of in: cf. Epod. 3. 18; 5. 31, 34; 11. 15, etc. 123. pupillo:
1. 1. 22. siliquis, ‘pulsa’ ‘husks'3 cf. Juv. 11. 58 ; Pers. 3. 55 where it
is used, as here, of the coarsest, simplest fare. secundo, not made of
siliqo (‘fine wheat flour ' J uv. 5. 70), but secundarius panis, ‘brown bread‚'
such as Augustus preferred (Suet. Aug. 76). 124. militiae: genitive
denoting that 111 point of -which the adjective is used3 Roby 1320, S. G.
526. Cf. S. 1. 10. 21 seri studiorum; Tac. Hist. 1. 87 urbanae militiae
inpiyer; 2. 5 acer militiae ,· 3. 43 strenuus militiae. Others less correctly
take it as the loeative. 125. 81 das . . ., i.e. if you allow that the state
can be served by the more retiring virtues, which the poet teaches.

127. iam nuno: before the time comes when he will have to apply such
Iessons‚ i.e. ‘in earliest youth ’3 cf. Propert. 4. (5.) 11. 93 discite venturam iam
‘nunc sentire senectam ,· A. P. 43 ut iam nune dicat iam ‘nunc (=at once)
debentia dici. 130. orientia tempora, ‘ his rising years‚' πλε. the time
while he is growing and developing3 cf. Vell. 2. 99. 1 orientium iuvenum
inqenia ,· Virg. Aen. 7. 51 primaque oriens erepta iuventa est. 131.
aegrum, ‘ sick at heart‚' as often in Cicero.

132. oum pueris puella: unquestionably a reference to the choirs of
youths and maidens for whom Horace had written the Carmen Saeculare. In
Od. 1. 21 we have a similar but briefer hymn. Livy 27. 37 describes how a
chorus of twenty-seven maidens sang hymns composed for them by Livius
Andronicus in honour of Juno Regina. 134. praesentia numina„ ‘the
favour of the gods ' ε for praeeem ‘ propitious ' cf. 1. 1. 69 ; 018. 111 Cat. 2. 9. 19.
