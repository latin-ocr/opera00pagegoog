374 HORACE EPODE xvn

tumulum sollemnibus), or perhaps there was a final sacrifice at the grave on
the ninth day after burial (novendiale dicitur saco-fficium, quod mortuo fit nona
die qua sepzdtus est, Porphyrion). Anyhow‚ by the phrase ‘ninth·day dust '
Horace clearly indicates that Canidia disturbs the ashes the first moment the
final rites are concluded, and she can safely do so without sear of interruption.
50. tuus . . . tuo. Emphatic: the sneer is the same as in 5. 5. Pac-
tumeius: the genuine name of a Roman gens. 52. fortis . . . ‘thou
leapest up (from thy couch) a sturdy mother.’ The recovery is so rapid as to
throw doubts on the reality of the illness, which, it is hinted‚ is only a device
to draw money from her lovers.

54. navitis, πλε. to their lamentations when shipwrecked on the rocks.
56. inultus . . . ‘shalt thou unavenged have treated the revelation of
Ootytto's mysteries as a J'est ’ἔ ’ For the indignant question ut . . . riseris ,2
cf. S. 2. 5. 18 utne &aqam spurco Damae latus? Cotytto is some Thracian
goddess whose mysteries were celebrated in connexion with licentious (cf.
liberi) orgies. 58. et Esquilini . . . Her ‘magio practices ' amid the
graves on the Esquiline are fully related in Sat. 1. 8. Canidia here ilnplies
that he was able to tell so much because he ‘was himself the chief performer,
‘the high priest of magi& on that occasion, and not a mere chance witness,
60. quid proderat, ‘what profit were it then (i.e. if you are to escape) to
me to have enriched Paelignian hags (zsse. by buying their secrets) orto have
mingled swifter (73.6. more than usually deadly) poisons ’.2 ’ Many MSS. have
proderit, ‘what profit will it be to me ’ἔ ’ Some, who adopt this reading,
explain the words as a taunting question put to Horace, ‘what profit will it
be to you to have studied these arts and to have mixed (for yourself) swiftest
Ρο18οΠ32’ to which the answer follows, ‘ none at all, for I will not let you die
quickly.' But to supply tibi after proderit is very hard. Moreover, where
has Horace hinted that he is going to poison himself ‘ very swiftly ’ἱῑ Canidia
wishes to emphasise her power; she knows how to compound ‘ very swift
poisons ² 3 but, as she immediately goes on to state, Horace must not imagine
that she is going to use them on him ; for him there waits ‘ a more lingering
doom ’ than he prays for.

63. in hoc . . . ut, ‘to this end that thou mayest ever be ready for new
sufferings.' 65. infidi. For the ‘ treachery ’ of Pelops to Myrtilus, the
charioteer of Oenomaus, by whose assistance he won the hand of Hippodamia,
see Class. Diet. Some MSS. give infidus, which would refer to the ‘ treachery ’
of Tantalus in betraying the secrets of the gods. 66. egens . . . ‘ever
craving for the bounteous feast,' which is ever before his eyes, but which he
can never touch ; hence our ‘tantalise.'

71. ense Norico: cf. Od. 1. 16. 9. 73. fastidiosa . . . ‘sad with loathing
weariness (of life)‚' 74. vectabor . . . ‘then Ι will ride mounted on thy
hated neck, and the earth shall yield to my triumphant pride ' 3 cf. Plaut.
Asin. 4. 1. 109, where a slave mounts on his master's back. 75. cedet . . .
τῖε. she will proudly spurn the ground on her novel steed, exactly like the
victor insolens in 16. 14. For insolentiae, the conduct of ‘ a beggar on horse-
back‚’ cf. Od. 1. 16. 21 n. 76. an . . . ‘or (cf. 6. 15 n.) am I, though I
have power (quae possim) to make waxen images feel . . . , to lament the
issue of my skill that effects nothing against thee ’ἐ ’ Wax images, represent-
ing the person who was to suffer enchantment, were pricked, burned, melted‚
and otherwise ill—treated in witchcraft3 cf. S. 1. 8. 303 Virg. Ecl. 8. 81.
79. excitare mortuos. Of. S. 1. 8. 30, and the witch of Endor. 80.
desideri pocula, φίλτρα, cf. 5. 38.
