special care must be taken to bring out the force of the emphatic words, viz.

only or the first persons who have deserved renown.

26. inlacrimabiles . . . ‘unwept and unknown lie buried in endless
night.’ inlacrimabilis is here used passively, but 2. 14. 6 ‘who never weepS.'
27. urguentur suggests the idea of night lying on them ‘like a tomb ' (Wick-

2. 16. 30 11. 28. sacro. Partly as being under the special protection of heaven,
