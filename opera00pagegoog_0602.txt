16. des nummos ε 0 jussive subjunctive: ‘let me have the money, if the
fact which I have mentioned, that he once ran away, does not trouble you ' 3
cf. Roby 1575, S.G. 657 (b). laedit is the reading of 1101. Bland. and is
probably original, the laedat 01 111051 MSS. being due to assimilation by copyists
to the neighbouring subjunctives. With laedat the speech 01 1110 manyo
must end at habenae and des is the apodosis to si quis velit in line 2 and
parallel to ferat in the next line: ‘you would pay the price (and) 110 would
pocket it.' excepta: 01. S. 2. 3. 285 ; Gell. 4. 2. 1 in edicto aedilium

of sale.’ 19. insequeris=6uhxec5‚ ‘prosecuta’ moraris, ‘annoy.'

21. talibus officiis t i.e. such friendly attentions as you are now demanding
from me. The case is probably dative ‘ of work contemplated ' (Roby 1156,
S. G. 481). mancum: S. 2. 7. 88. mea is curiously out of place.
22. iurgares, ‘ scold' ; cf. line 171 11. rediret: much better in itself,
and far better supported than veniret of the older editions. Florus expected
a letter from Horace in answer to his own 3 cf. 1. 13. 2. 23. tum, i.e.

unum Virg. Aen. 5. 687, ‘to a man.’ 28. vehemens: so all MSS. and
also line 120 where the metre makes vemens necessary. Lachmann on Lucret.
2. 1024 (nam tibi vemenler nova res molitur ad aures accedere) shows that
vehemens is not necessarily an anapaest anywhere before a letter 01 Marcus
Aurelius. lupus: another instance 01 1110 1150 01 metaphor for simile,
which is so common in Horace3 01. 1. 1. 2, 42; 7. 74; 10. 42. 30.
