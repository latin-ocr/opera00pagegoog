ODE XXXVII

An Ode written on the news of Cleopatra’s death, which was brought to
Rome in the autumn of B.C. 30 by M. Tullius Cicero, the son os the orator.
No mention is made of the death of M. Antonius, because the defeat os a
Roman citizen earned no triumph, cf. 3. 8. 18 11. The Ode bears traces‘of
being written hastily in a moment of enthusiasm. Its power is undeniable‚
but in more finished Odes Horace would not admit such lines as 5 and 14.
For the bitter Roman hatred of Cleopatra see Propertius 4. 11 (Paley's ed.) ;
for the battle of Actium, Epod. 9, Prop. 5. 6, Virg. Aen. 8. 675.

1. nunc est bibendum . . . Copied from Alcaeus, νῦν χρὴ μεθύσθην
καί τινα πρὸς βίαν Ι πίνην ἐπειδὴ κάτθανε Μύρσιλος. The general meaning is
‘ Now drinking, now dancing, now public thanksgiving are fitting.' Horace
expresses the idea of fitness first by a gerund, secondly by a gerundive‚
thirdly (for variety's sake) by the idiomatic ‘’twere time' (13.6. if we
were wise). The first ‘nuuc goes with bibendum (‘now for a drink'), the
second with pulsanda, and the third with ornare. For tempus erat cf.
Mart. 4. 33 plena laboratis habeas cum scrinia chartis, Ι emittis quare,
Sosibiane, nihil? Ι ⁴ edent, haeredes' inquis ‘ mea carmina! Qucwzol02 Ι tempus
erat iam te, Sosibia‘ne, Ze9i; Ov. Tr. 4. 8. 24 me quoque donari iam rude
tempus erat ,⁶ Liv. 8. 5. 3 tempus erat . . . iam v'os ayere . . . cum nunc
videretis. All editors join the first nunc with est (‘now is the time to
drink ³), and so are driven to join the third with tempus erat, but nunc erat
thus following mmo est and bearing the same sense is extremely harsh.
2. pulsanda tellue3 of J'oyous dancing3 cf. 3. 18. 15. Saliaribus:
see last Ode line 12, and for the luxury of priestly feasts 2. 14. 28 mero Ι
pontificum potiore cenis, 3. pulvinar : see Dict. of Ant.

5. depromere. Some explain ‘bring down,’ the apotheca or store-room
for wine being in the upper part of the house, where the wine mellowed more
quickly, but depromere is generally used merelyz‘to bring forth ’ or ‘out.’
Caecubum avitis: the wine is choice and old. 6. Capitolio regina.
N otice the juxtaposition invidiae causa. The Romans abhorred the word
rese, how much more regina, and in connexion with their national temple, the
very sign and pledge of Rome’s greatness? Cf. 3. 3. 423 Lucan 10. 62
terruit illa suo, si fae, Capitolia sistro. 7. dementes ruinae, ‘ mad
ruin,' i.e. the ruin she hoped for in her madness. Hypallage, cf. 3. 1. 42 n.

9. contaminato . . . ‘with her filthy herd of men hideous through
disease, mad enough to hope for anything and intoxicated with good fortune.'
The reference is to her Oriental eunuch slaves, called viri in bitter irony.
10. inpotens=the Gk. ἀκράτης, which is the opposite of ἐγκράτης ⁴ one who
has command over himself,' cf. 3. 30. 3. The word is well applied to an
Eastern sovereign in whom uncontrolled power has raised uncontrollable and
impossible desires. For the epexegetic inf. sperare, tractare line 27, and deduci
line 31, cf. 1. 3. 25 n. 13. vix una sospes . . . Cleopatra's fleet really
got away: that of Antony consisting of 300 vessels was almost wholly de-
stroyed. 14. lymphatam, ‘delirious‚' ‘distraught.' This curious word
(cf. larvatus, cerritus S. 2. 3. 278 11.) 13 said to ὴθτνυμφόληπτος ‘nymph-
