at Aricia or Veii would be of more value than those at a distance from Rome.
Veii had been lying in ruins since its capture by Camillus (396 B.c.), and its
land had been divided among the soldiers 01 Julius Caesar in 45 B.c. These
formed a small colony, which was dispersed during the wars of the triumvirs,
and Propertius 4. (5.) 10. 29 in a poem probably written about the time of
this Epistle speaks of the land within its walls as given up to herdsmen and
reapers. For Aricia cf. S. 1. 5. 1. 168. emptum is the emphatic word ε
‘if a man has bought land 01 old . . .· the vegetables on which he dines are
bought: bought too are the logs ² etc. 169. sub noctem, ‘ towards night-
fa11,' ‘ as the chill of night 0011103 011,’ 01. Od. 2. 1. 14 n.

170. suum, ie. ‘he calls all (the land) his own’: usque . Ι. . qua, ‘as
far as the spot where ' ε adsita, ‘ planted near ' or close by the limites to mark
them. The poplar is used to mark the boundaries 3 like the beeches 111 Virg.
Ecl. 9. 9 usque ad aquam et veterem, iam fracta cacumina, fayos. 171.
limitibus: the limites were properly strips or balks of land, left uncul-
tivated in order to mark the boundaries of estates and used as highways. The

case may be either dat. or abl. of place. Schiitz less probably takes it as an ·

abl. of instrument: but the limites were certi before the tree was planted.
refugit: the tree is said itself to avoid the quarrels‚ which it enables the
owner to avoid. So Varr0, in speaking of this very custom of planting trees
to mark boundaries, says (R. R. 1. 15) praeterea sine saeptis fines praedii
sationibus ‘notis arborum tutiores fiunt, ‘ne familiae rixentur cum vicini-5, ac
limites ex litibus iudicem quaerant. The perfect tense probably=has
ever since it was planted avoided. Bentley with poor authority read
refiyii (=resolvii). vicina. iurgia, ‘differences with the neighbours ':

so Soph. Ant. 793 νεῖκος ξύναιμὸν. 172. sit: Roby 1580, S. G. ἱ

660. The pres. subj. is used in such sentences, unless there is historic
sequence, even though the hypothesis is not one viewed as possible. For the
sentiment cf. S. 2. 129-133. puncto mobilis horae: the ‘ fleeting hour ’
is regarded as a mere ⁴ speck ' or ⁴ point ’ of time. punctum temporis is a very
usual expression, but Lucr. 4. 201 has puncto diei. 01. S. 1. 1. 7 horae
momento. 173. nunc prece, nunc pretio: with intentional alliteration,
01. Ον. Fast. 2. 805 instat amans hostis precibus pretioque minisque: nec prece
nee pretio ‘nee movet ille mini& morte suprema, ‘ by death which closes
all’ ; cf. 2. 1. 12 ; 1. 16. 793 so ultima mors S. 1. 7. 13. 174. in altera
iura=in alterius iura, 1.0. potestatem. 01. Virg. G. 4. 37 utraque vis (sc.
friqoris et caloris) 3 Aen. 4. 357 testor utrumque caput ,· Munro on Lucr. 2. 433.

177. vici: sc. rustici3 Acron explains villae, but the word conveys more
than that: rather ‘estates ’ or ‘ mauors ' 3 cf. Cic. ad Att. 1. 4 Crassum divi-
tiis supero, atque omnium vicos et prata contemno, Calabris . . . Lucani:
flocks of sheep were pastured in the plains of Calabria or Apulia during the
winter, and driven up into the hills of Lucania or Samnium for the summer.
cf. Epod. 1. 27 ; Varro, R. R. 2. 1. 16 itaque qreyes ovium Zonye abiguntur ex
Apulia iri Samnium aestivatum; a similar practice is still observed in Spain
for the Merino sheep. 178. metit ε Orcus is the true reaper after all ; the
‘ reaper whose name is Death.’

180-189. Some meri valae hiyldy what others care nothing] for. Even
brothers have stranqely different casces, and the reason for this is mysterious.
