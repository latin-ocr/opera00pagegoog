presence of the Muses. Theirs had not only been a ‘fair companionship,' but
they had also ‘with singing cheered the way.’ (Tennyson, In Mem. c. 22.)

ODE VII

‘ Pompeius, with whom I once saw service under Brutus, with whom I have
osten joined in revetry, who has thus restored you to your civit riqhts ,2 How I
remember beinq in the rout of Philippi with you, when I ran away so inqtori-
ously and M ereury spirited me away safe home, while you were sucked back
into the tempest and tumult of the war ,Ι Come offer a sacrifice to Jupiter sor
your return, and then we wilt hold a reokless revel beneath the taureis here. On
such a day I scorn to be sober!

1. saepe, i.e. during the two years before the battle of Philippi.
tempus in ultimum deducte, ‘led down into uttermost peril when
Brutus was our leader.' There seems a play on words in deducte . . . duce.
tempus here=⁶ a critical period of time ' ; the notion of ‘peril ’ attaches to it
from ultimum, which implies danger. Cf. Cic. Phil. 5. 17. 46 tempore summo
reipublicae ‘at an extreme crisis of the state‘3 Catull. 64. 151, 169. 2.
Bruto. M. BrutuS, the murderer of Caesar, commanded, along with Cassius,
at Philippi (13.0. 42). 3. redonavit Quiritem, ‘given thee back a (full)
citizen.' After Philippi most of the republican party were pardoned by
Octavian, Horace among them: Pompeius, however, seems still to have re-
mained in arms with the relics of the beaten faction, and had only just been
amnestied. Quirites signifies a Roman citizen in full possession of his civil
rights, or, in legal phrase, capite non deminutus. Hence in public documents
the phrase populus Romanus Quiritium, and among the Jurists, ius Quiritium.
The word was only applied to Roman citizens in a civil capacity, never to
soldiers; hence the point of Caesar's beginning a speech to the mutinous
Tenth legion with the word Quirites. '

5. sodalium, ‘ comrades in enj0yment ' in connexion with the lines which
follow. 6. morantem . . . fregi, ‘I have often with (the aid of) wine
defeated a wearisome day! franyere is comm0n=‘crush,’ ‘defeat,' ‘break
the back of ἐ the day threatened to be dull and tedicus, but Horace had a
remedy powerful enough to defeat its threats and make it move along fast and
pleasantly. 7. coronatus . . . : lit. ‘garlanded as to my locks glisten-
ing with Syrian unguent,' i.e. wearing a garland on my looks, etc. 8. malo-
bathrum is a corruption of the Indian name for a plant from which unguent
was extracted. It is called ‘ Syrian’ because Indian products were brought to
the sea-coast through Syria, and bought by Roman merchants in Syria, so
that all such merchandise is indiscriminately called ‘ Syrian.' Cf. 2. 11. 16.

9. Philippos et celerem fugam, ‘Philippi’s hurried mut: A good
instance of Hendiadys (ἓν διὰ δυοῖν) or the use of two words or phrases simply
put side by side, instead of a single complex phrase in which the words
qualisy each other. Cf. 1. 35. 33 cicatricum fratrumque ‘ wounds inflicted
by brethren,' 3. 4. 4 fidibus citharaque, 3. 4. 43 Titanas inmanemque turmam,
CaeS. B. Gr. 4. 18 solitudinem et silvas. 10. sensi: a favourite word of
Horace,=‘feel to one’s cost,’ ‘feel anything painfflff Cf. 4. 4. 25 sensere, of
the conquered tribes ‘feeling to their cost’ the power of Rome3 3. 27. 22
sentiant motus, of those at sea; 3. 5. 36 lora sensit iners ,· A. P. 66.
relicta non bene parmula. Horace speaks of his military career as of
something he can look back upon as too absurd to be talked of gravely ; that
