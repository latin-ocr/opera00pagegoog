554 HORACE Boox 1 ΕΡ. xx

the letter, which is much better fitted to be addressed to the general public
than to boys using the poems as a first reading—book. 20. libertino
patre: S. 1. 6. 45. in tenui re: -1113 father was macro pauper ayello,

S. 1. 6. 71. 21. nido with maiores, ‘too great for my nest to hold ² ε cf.
S. 2. 3. 310 corpore maiorem ,· od. 2. 11. 11.

23. belli . . . domique: the rhythm of the line seems to connect these
words with placuisse rather than with primi-3, but sense demands that they
should go with the latter. Horace could not have ventured to assert that his
military exploits woan favour with the priam—mois. Besides Augustus,
Pollio, Munatius Plancus, Messala and others were distinguished in war as
well as in peace. 24. corporis exigui: sc. esse, ‘short ' not slight: see

f‘ffi'tr. x. praecanum, ‘grey before my time ἐ 30 the scholiasts explain
the word. Usually mae compounded with an adj. is simply intensive, e. 9.
praealtus, praecalidus, praecelsus, praecele‘r etc.; and it is as a rule only when
compounded with verbs that it has the meaning of ‘before—hand'; hence
some maintain that the meaning must be ‘ very grey.’ Bufffie formation of
praematurus differs in no way from that of praecanus‘, and that of praecox,
praesayuT, praenuntius very slightly. So we may rest content with the tradi-
tional explanation. solibus aptum, ‘fond of sunning myself ' ; cf. S. 2.

s 5. 45 aptus amieis; S. 1. 3. 29 aptus acutis naribus; Juv. T‘ES cupidus sa-
varum aptusque bibendis Ι fontibus Aonidum. For the practice of sunning
one's self (apricatio) cf. Plin. Ep. 3. 5. 10 (of the elder Pliny) aestate, si quid

otii, iacebat in sole . . . post solem plerumque friyida lavabatur ,· ib. 6. 16. 5
usus ille sote, ‘mox friyida; 3. 1. 8 (of Spurinna) in sole, si caret vento, am-
bulat nudus, The usual place for this was the helio-caminu3‚ ⁴ sun·oven‚'
built on purpose: cf. Mayor on Juv. 11. 203, and Pers. 5. 179 aprici sene&
Many needless emendations have been made for aptum, e.g. ustum, assum, atrum.

(- 27. Decembres: Suetonius gives the date of Horace's birth as sexto idus
Decembris The year of his birth is fixed by od. 3. 21. 1 o nata mecum oon-
sule Manlia and by Epod. 13. 6 tu vina Torquato move consule pressa ‘meo to
the consulship of L. Manlius Torquatus and L. Aurelius Cotta ih 65 B.0.
28. dixit has no authority worth considering. duait was unquestionably the
reading of the archetype. On the other hand eolleQdieere is the regular
technical term for the ‘nominagtion ' of a consul after lns election by a col-
league who for any reason had been previously elected (cf. Mommsen, Rom.
Staatsr. 12. 209). The question then arises whether it is more probable that
Horace should have employed a phrase nowhere else found, and extremely
hard to explain by the usage of the language, or that an error of one slight
stroke should have crept into the archetype. When we consider passages like
1. 5. 283 7. 96; Epod. 1. 153 4. 83 S. 1. 6. 102; 10. 86, 130 take only
cases where the archetype was unquestionably corrupt, we can hardly hesitate
which way We should decide. Porph. explains duxit by sortitus est ‘quia
sortem duci dicivmas ' z but there was no question of the lot in the election of
consuls, Orelli says vetuti praecedens Lollius post se quasi comitem ali-
quanto tardiorem duxit Lepidum. Lollius (333 Od. 4. 9 Intr.) was consul in
21 Β.0., and the other consulship, at first intended for Augustus himself, was
ultimately filled up by the appointment of Aemilius Lepidus.
