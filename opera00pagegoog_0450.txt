422 , HORACE 6001( 1

visere, or visere ad, often has this meaning ; cf. Ep. 2. 2. 69. 18. cubat,
‘keeps his bed‚' from 1116655. Of. 2. 3. 289 mater ait pueri menses iam
quinque cubantis ; Ep. 2. 2. 68; Ov. Her. 20. 164 hacc cubat, ille valet.
hortos ε Caesar’s gardens, left in his will to the people as a public park, were
011 the Janiculum, close to the Tiber. 21. dorso, ‘with his back ' ; cf. Virg.
Aen. 2. 708 ipsc subibo umeris. subiit: cf. 1. 5. 9O n. onus: accusative.

22. si bene me novi: so Circe, Ovid Met. 14. 356 si modo mc novi.
Viscum: cf. 1. 10. 83. The two Visci, sons of Vibius Viscus a Roman
knight‚ were literary men, and intimate friends of Horace. 23. plures:
cf. 1. 4. 16 videamus uter plus scribere possit. 25. mollius, ‘more lightly‚’
in the dance. mollis in this sense preserves a reference to its assumed deriva-
tion, mobilis, Of. Lucr. 4. 980 cernere saltantis et mollia membra moventis ,-
Ov. A. A. 1. 595 si vox est, canta; si mollia bracchia, salta. membra:
see Munro 06 Lucr. 4. 790, where 116 shows that the motions of the arms were
of more importance 16 ancient dancing than the legs. 26. est tibi mater . . .
Why does Horace ask this 2 Schiitz and Kiessling think it ss a hint that the
stranger was mad, and wanted some one to look after him3 Orelli that hc
wishes to turn the subject, and to stop the bore’s account of himself. Others
make other suggestions, but the real reason why the question is askecl is to ·
introduce the excellent point which follows. 28. composui, ‘ 1 have laid
them all to rest.' componere is properly to lay the bones of the dead together
in the urn, after they have been gathered from the pyre (cf. Prop. 2. 24. 35
tu mea compones et dices ‘oss-a, Properti, Ι haec tua sunt ’ ; Ov. Met. 4. 157) ;
but is also used of arranging the limbs of the dead together on the bier, or bed
of death (cf. Ov. Met. 9. 504 toroque Ι ‘mortua componam Pers. 3. 104 alto Ι
cmnpositus lecto), and it is in this sense Pope writes, ‘By foreign hands thy
decent limbs composed ' ; but that is not the meaning here. felices: from
this word to aetas, in 34, is to be taken as spoken aside, or rather as the un-
uttered expression of Horace’s thought: ‘lucky they’ (in being beyond the
reach of your tongue). nunc ego resto: sc. tibi componendae, ‘ my
turn next ! ' cf. Pers, 3. 97 iampridem hunc sepeli, tu' restas,

29. confice, ‘despatch me Γ Sabella: the Sabellian tribes were
noted for witchcrast, especially the Marsi and Peligni ; cf. Epod. 17. 28, 29, 60;
5. 76. 30. divina, ‘fortune-telling ’ 3 cf. Od. 3. 27. 10. 13316161, holding
that divina mota ,anus urna jars harshly 011 1116 ear, accepts Bentley’s trans-
position mota divina anus. mota ε 5116 shook her lots in an urn, and then
drew out some, from which she told Horace’s fortune ; cf. Od. 2. 3. 26 ; 3. 1.
16. 32. laterum dolor : pleurisy. tarda podagra, ‘halting gout ' ;
cf. Prop. 2. 1. 59 tarda Philoctetae sanavit crura Machaon. 33. quando
. . . cumque, ‘some time or other.' quandocumque generally means ‘when-
soever ² ε quandoque, ‘ some time or other ’ ; but they interchange in meaning
with each other. Of. Ov. Met. 6. 544 quandocumque mihi poenas dabie, and
for the reverse, Od. 4. 1. 17; Α. Ρ. 359.

35. ad. Vestae : sc. templum ; 5ο 16 Greek εἰς Ἀπόλλωνος, εἰς Ἀσκληπιοῦε
16 English ‘to St. Paul’s,’ etc. Vesta's fane was near the Forum between the
Capitol and Palatine. quarta iam parte ε 11 was about 9 o’clock, which
was Horace’s usual hour for a morning stroll. This was the time when busi?
ness went on in the law-courts‚ Mart. 4. 8. 2 exercet ‘raucos tertia causidicos.
36. respondere: a technical word, ‘to put in an appearance in court.’‘
Varr. ap. Gell. 11. 1. 4 M. Terentio, quando citatus neque respondit neque
excusatus est, eqo ei ‘tonum ovem multam dico· vadato is 36 impersonal
