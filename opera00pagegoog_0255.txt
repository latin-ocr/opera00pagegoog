Romans however love to set the contrasted clauses side by side without any
adversative particle. The Greeks would use μέν and δέ.

ODE XXVI

‘ I am the friend of the Musca and therefore will throw sorrow and anxiety
to the winda utterly untroubled by ware and rumours of mars, Help me
rather, O Muse, to weave a chaplet of verse for Lamia, for he is worthffi

The date is determined by the political allusion as about B.c. 30. Wick-
ham says: ‘Phraates IV. to whom Orodes I. had resigned his throne in Β.6.
38, after some years of tyranny‚ provoked his subJ'ects to the point of re-
bellion. He was expelled, and Tiridates, another member of the Arsacid

house, was put on the throne in his place. After a short time Phraates was
restored and Tiridates fied to seek the protection of Augustus‚' cf. 2. 2. 17,
and 3. 8. 19. For Lamia see 3. 17 Intr.

2. tradam portare veniae, ‘I will give to the winds to carry.’ The inf.
seems epexegetic‚ further defining the phrase tradam ventis: cf. Virg. Aen.
1. 319 dederatque comam diffundere venti-9, Hom. Il. 23. 512 δῶκε δ’ ἄγειν
ἑτάροισιν ὑπερθύμοισι γυναῖκα. 3. quis sub Arcto . . . ‘supremely
indifferent who is feared as king of the cold region beneath the Bear.' The
reference is to the king of the Dacians, cf. 3. 8. 18, and for the dread of the
Dacians 3. 6. 14 ; S. 2. 6. 53 3 Virg. G. 2. 497 coniurato descendens Dacus ab
Istro. The balance with quid shows that quis is nom. and not-:quibua
nor does Horace use the contracted quis in the OdeS.

6. integris. The haunts of the Muses are unpolluted by morta] presence z
the poet alone may approach them. Cf. Lucr. 1. 926 iuvat integros accedere
fontes, 7. necte flores, necte. See N otes on MetreS‚ p. xviii. ξ 4. 9.
Pimplei. Πίμπλεια was a town or fountain in Pieria ; hence in Alexandrine
poets Πιμπληίδες = Muses, MSS. have Pimpleam, but Porphyrion read.
Pimplei. mei honores, ‘the honours (of song) which I can confer.’
10. fidibus novis, ‘ strings before unheard.' Because Horace was the first
to write Latin 1511163, cf. 3. 30. 13. 11. Lesbio: 1. 1. 34 n. sacrare:
because caelo Musa beat .· ‘ to consecrate ’ and so ‘ make immortaL' plectro ε
πλῆκτρον, the striking thing, ‘ quill.'

ODE XXVII

‘ Come, my cmnrades, ‘no quarrellinq .· ’tis barbaram. Κεφ your places
and do not shout so. What! would you have me drinlc more? WeZZ, I will,
‘gif MeyyZZa's brother will yive as a coast the name os his sweetheart. Are you
hesitatiny? θανεῖν you need ‘not be ashamed .· no doubt she is a lady. Αἰαε, poor
wretch, you deserved α better fate .· you have fallen into the dulches os α harpys

The Ode is a playful sketch of an imaginary scene at a wine-party.

1. natis . . . ‘destined (as it were) by nature for purposes of pleasure.’
2. Thracum: gen. plural. For their drinking habits cf. 1. 36. 14 ; 1. 18. 8.
One of the metopes of the Parthenon (see Smith's class. Dict. s.v. Centaur)
contains a representation of a Centaur using a large diota as a weapon of
offence. The manner of Mr. Bardell's decease is strictly classical. tollite,
‘ away with? 3. verecundum, ‘ who loves moderation'3 cf. modici Ia‘he‘m',

1. 18. 7. It may also refer to the fresh, blushing face of the youthful divinity.
4. prohibete, ‘keep apart from?
