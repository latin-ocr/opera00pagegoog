‘you know how I put the paint on there’ ; Plin. Ep. 1. 2. 4; so ληκυθίζειν
in later Greek, and Callimachus called tragedy ληκὺθειος Μοῦσα (Frag. 319).
The more usual interpretation, however, of ampullari is ‘ to swell,' ‘ use swelling
words‚' assuming that the reference is to the round belly of the ampulla: cf.
A. P. 97. Kiessling says λήκυθος is ‘ the Adam’s apple’ in the throat (see
Schol. Plat. Hipp. Min. 368 c) and so ληκυθίζειν describes deep-voiced mouthing.

15. mihi: Roby 1150, S. G. 473. Celsus: probably the Celsus Al·
binovanus, to whom l. 8 is addressed. 16. privatas opes, ‘ stores of his
own‚’ avoiding too close an imitation of the classic writers who had already
found their place in the public library. Horace is giving a kindly warning
rather than gravely censuring Celsus for plagiarism. 17. Palatinus Apollo :
in 28 B.C. Augustus had built a temple on the Palatine to Apollo in com-
memoration of his victory at Actium (Dio Cass· 53. 1): and addidit porticus
cum bibliotheca Latina Graecaque (Suet. Aug. 29). This building was close
behind the palace of Augustus, so that when the emperor was in ill-health, the
senate was summoned to assemble there. Mr. Burn (Rome, 175) says ‘the
cloisters which surrounded the temple united it with the famous Greek and
Latin library ’ ε but it seems rather that the porticus contained the libraries‚
and not a distinct bu11ding, of which there is no trace. It is plain, too, from
inscriptions in which they are mentioned separately, that the Greek and the
Latin Libraries were quite distinct, aq. in the famous columbarium discovered
in 1852 (Wilmanns‚ Ex. Inscr. Lat. pp. 125 seq.) we find two sons described
as both a bybliothece Latina Apollinis, another as ab bybliothece Graeca
templi A pollinis. ; and we find mention also of a Ti. Claudius Alcibiades
mem. a bybliotheca Latina Apollinis item scriba ab epistulis Lat. The
splendid columns, doors and statues of the aurea porticus are described
by Propert. 3. 29. For the busts of authors which adorned it cf. Tae.
Ann. 2. 83. recepit, ‘has taken under his charge‚' so that they may
not be touched with impunity. 19. cornicula: Horace departs from
the familiar Aesopian fable (Babr. 7 2, Phaedr. 1. 3) in two ways, by substituting
a ‘crow ' or ‘rook ’ for a graculus ⁴ jackdaw,' or possibly ‘J'ay,' and by repre-
senting the feathers as dropped by various birds, each one of whom comes to
reclaim his own. 20. coloribus, ⁴ plumis variorum colorum ’ Schol.

20-29. What are you attemptiuy yourself 2 You have ability enough to
wiri distinction in either oratory, law or poclm, if you would put aside lower
aims, aud remember your duty to yowr country. 21. agilis: not of ver-
satility as Orelli, but simply studio indefesso, as Ritter sayS. thyma: so
Horace compares himself to a bee, gathering honey from the blossoms of the
thyme (Od. 4. 2. 27), and Sophocles was called Ἀτθὶς μέλισσα : cf. too Plato,
Ion 534 A λέγουσι . . . ’γὰρ πρὸς ἡμᾶς οἱ ποιηταί, ὅτι ἀπὸ κρηνῶν μελιρρύτων
ἐκ Μουσῶν κήπων τινῶν καὶ ναπῶν δρεπόμενοι τὰ μέλη ἡμῖν φέρουσιν ὥσπερ αἱ
μέλιτται καὶ αὐτοὶ οὕτω πετόμενοι. 22. hirtum, ‘ rough,' as the result of
neglect, the metaphor being from land overgrown with weeds t we should say
rather ‘ unpolished.’ In good prose an adverb of quality, as distinguished
from one of degree, is not used with an adjective, as here, and A. P. 3 turpiter
atrum ,· Od. 3. 11. 35 splendide mendax. 23. acuis ε a metaphor derived
from sharpening a weapon‚ Cic. Brut. 97. 331 tu illuc (inforum) veneras uuus,
qui non linquam modo acuisses exercitatione dicendi etc. So θήγειν γλῶσσαν.
The reference is to the practice of declamation, cf. 1. 2. 2. civica iura
respondere : in prose ius civile respondere. For respondere with an acc. ‘ to
put forward in a reply,’ disputare ‘ to put forward in a discussion‚' cf. Reid on
