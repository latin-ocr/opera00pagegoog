ARS POETICA

THE place now generally assigned to the Epistola ad 1313307163, as the third
Epistle of the second book, rests upon no ancient authority. In the MSS. it

’ always appears, detached from the other Epistles, either after the fourth book

of the Odes or after the Carmen Saeculare. H. Stephanus first placed it at
the end of his edition : and Cruqujus set the fashion, which has recently been
revived, of denoting it as Epistolarum Lib. 2. Ep. 3. The editors who have
given it this position seem to have been led to do so by their view as to the
date of its production. It has been commonly supposed to be the latest of
the works of Horace 3 and the want of structural completeness‚ which it un-
doubtedly displays, if regarded as a poetical treatise ‘ On the Art of Poetry,’
has been considered as a proof that it was never finished, and probably was
not published by the poet himself. This theory has been further confirmed
by the assumption made as to the identity of the PisoneS, to whom the Epistle
was addressed. Porphyrion begins his commentary with the words: hune
librum, qui inscribitur de arte poetica, ad Lucium Pisonem, qui postea urbis
eustos fuit, eiusque liberos misit ,· nam et ipse Piso poeta fuit et studiorum
liberalium antisteS. This Lucius Piso was the son of the enemy of Cicero ε 116
was born 48 B.c., was consul in 15 B.o., and under Tiberius became praefectus
urbi, an office which he held for twenty years, according to Tacitus, 'dying in
A.D. 32 at the age of eighty. Now it is Just possible that this Piso had two sons,
old enough to be addressed as iuvenes, before the death of Horace in 8 B.c.
But it is only by straining probabilities to the utmost, that we can bring these
young Pisos into connexion with Horace ; and the difficulty thus arising makes
us inclined to look for other indications of an earlier date, which would show
that the statement of Porphyrion is erroneous. Some of these indications, as
put together by A. Michaelis and supplemented by Prof. Nettleship, are :-—

(1) Ρ. Maecius Tarpa is mentioned in line 387 as a critic whose judgment
would be of value to a young composer. Now in 55 B.c. Maecius was en-
trusted by Pompeius with the superintendence of the plays and other spectacles
to be produced in the stone theatre‚ which he had just built. It is indeed
conceivable that at that time he was not more than thirty years of age, and
that in 8 B.c. he was still living at the age of seventy-seven ; but it is much
easier to understand the reference, if it was made some ten or twelve years earlier.
Horace mentions him as a critic of plays in S. 1. 10. 38, i.e. about 35 B.c.

(2) In line 371 Aulus Cascellius is mentioned as a type of a learned lawyer,
in connexion with Messalla, who is a type of eloquence. The language used
indicates that both were living, and certainly Messalla was. But Cascellius
was already famous in 56 13.c., and could hardly be living in 8 B.c.

(3) On the other hand in line 438 Quintilius Varus is spoken of in a manner
which implies that he was dead, but as though he had been known to the
young Pisos, and was not long dead. Now he died 24 13.c. ; cf. Od. 1. 14 Intr.

(4) The reference to Virgil and Varius in line 55 is much more appropriate,
if we suppose them both to be living, or at any rate that the Aeneid had been
very recently published. Horace is evidently contending for a right which
was disputed by the critics of his time, and in the thick of the battle t he is
