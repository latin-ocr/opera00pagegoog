214 HORACE p Boon 1

51. Caesarie, πλε. Augustus. tu . . . ‘reign thou, and may Caesar
be second 10 11100.’ reynes is not 30 much a prayer as an ascription of praise.
The use of secundus here after what has been said in lines 18, 19 13 difficult.

Antithetical Juxtaposition: their sweetness makes the barbarity grosser, cf.
2. 4. 6 11. 16. quint-,a parte sui nectaris. Some take quinta vaguely
=a ‘ considerable ' part. But Horace refers to the Pythagorean division of
all things into four elements, earth, air, fire, and water, and a certain ‘ fifth
existence ' (quinta essentia, πεμπτὴ οὐσία, quintessence) of a higher nature
which informs and animates the rest, and therefore means ‘ the best part of
her own sweetness.' 1¹7. ter et amplius. A slight variation from the
ordinary terque quaterque. 20. suprema citius die, ⁴ sooner than the

gaythof death ' put by a natural inaccuracy for ‘ sooner than on the day of
