SATIRE 1 NOTES 431

9. inriguumque merc. · to go to bed βεβρεγμένον, ‘soaked' with wine,
seems really to have been believed by the Romans to be a cuie sor sleepless-
ness3 Prop. 3.17. 13 quod si, Bacche, tais per fervida tempor ·a donis Ι arces-
sitas erit sommis iri ossa mea. Trebatius himself, like many lawyers, was
fond of wine, cf. Cic. ad Fam. 7. 22. Trebatius and Cicero were supping
together, and Trebatius made fun of Cicero over their cups sor' ignorance on
a certain legal point (illuseras heri inter scyphos). Cicero looked up the
authorities when he went home etsi bene potus seroque ,· and finding he was
right, sent Trebatius a note next day to tell him so.

10. rapit, ‘ hurries you along,' with an irresistible impulse. 11.
Caesaris: he did not take the tit-le of Augustus until 27 B.C. res: sc.
flectas, martial exploits. 12. praemia: the approbation of Caesar and
the applause of men, according to Orelli, but Trebatius certainly had also
more substantial praemia in his mind. pater: a title of respect and
familiarity3 cf. Ep. 1. 6. 54. Old Trebatius was about twice Horace’s age,
and calls him puer line 60. 13. horrentia pilis agmina: the Roman
legions whose special weapon was the pilum. They are contrasted with
fracta . . . Gallos, ‘the Gauls perishing with broken lance ἐ cf. a similar
contrast in Byron, Childe Harold 2. 90 ‘ The flying Mede, his shaftless‚ broken
bow31 sse fiery Greek, his red pursuing spear.' cuspis is explained by
Orelli and others of the Roman javelins, reference being made to a plan devised
by Marius by which the head was partly broken off the shaft after striking its
mark, so that it could not be hurled back by the enemy, Plutarch, Marius c.
23 ; but such a recondite reference is out of place in these brilliant and vivid
lines. 14. Gallos: Octavian had carried on various wars against Gallie
tribes since 40 B.c. ; Agrippa defeated the Aquitani in 38 ; M. Valerius Mes-
salla triumphed over the Gauls after the Battle of Actium. 15. labentis
with simple abl, as lapsum temone Virg. Aen. 12. 470. describit and de-
scribat are both excellent readings, equally supported by MSS. For the
indicative cf. A. P. 2633 Ep. 1. 17. 36. On the other hand, Horace is fond
of the potential with negatives: 1. 4. 70, 71 ; 6. 89. Parthi: cf. Od.
1. 19. 11 n. -

16. poteras: like erat line 7, ‘you might have ' ε if you could not tell of
his exploits you might have described his virtues. 17. Scipiadam: an
irregular patronymic used by Lucilius, LucretiuS‚ and Virgil, for Scipionem,
*which could not be brought into a hexameter. A true patronymic would be
Scipionides. The Scipio was Scipio Africanus the younger. sapiens is
'‘knowing‚' ‘worldly wise’ 3 see on l. 1. 38 (sapiens formica). Horace hints
that Lucilius showed his savoir faire in selecting a theme which would repay

him. 18. cum res ipsa feret, ‘when circumstances of themselves shall
prompt, ' ‘ when opportunity shall permit ': cf. Cic. ad Fam. 10. 21. 6 si occasio
1ταίενῑῖίέ; Virg. Aen. 2. 34. 20. si palpem, recalcitrat. the indica-

tive present, unexpectedly following a subjunctive, perhaps describes the
suddenness and unexpectedne'ss of a horse' s kick.

22. cf. 1. 8.11. 24. quid faciam, ‘how can I help it‚’ excusandi
formula. I must follow my bent, says Horace, like Milonius and others;
Pers. 1. 12 quid faciam? sed sum petulanti splene cachinno. Milonius:
unknown. ut semel, ‘ as soon as ever,' stronger than simul ac. icto z
cf. Plaut. OaS. 3. 5. 16 haec meraclo se uspiam percussit flore Liberi ,· Tib. 1.
2. 3 multo percussum tempora Baccho. 25. numerusque lucernis:
⁶ drunken men see double'; cf. Juv. 6. 304 vertiqine tectum 1 ambulat el yemim's
