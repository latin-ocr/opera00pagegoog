os Macedon. And yet increase of wealth means increase of care. I am right,
Maecena& in following] your example and ‘not secking] to tower above my sellom&
I join the ranks os the contented and am more proud in the ownership of my
charminy Sabine farm than ff I owned the most valuable estates. For, though
I am in humble, I am ‘not in straitened circumstances ; and to want little is
the greatest wealth, the yreatest boon Heaven can bestow.'

1. Danae: see Class. Dict. sv, Acrisius aenea: cf. Soph. Ant. 946 Δανάας

. . ἐν χαλκοδέτοις αὐλαῖς. The adj. marks the strength of the prison, but
probably has its origin ‘through a reminiscence of a tomb (like the Treasury
of Atreus at Mycenae) to the walls of which bronze plates had been nailed '—
Jebb. 2. robustae: in connexion with aenea=‘oaken‚’ from robur:
‘oak-wood‚' cf. 1. 3. 9. 3. munierant, ‘had protected‚' i.e. ‘would cer-
tainly have protected ’ ; for the indicative cf. 2. 17. 28 n.

6. pavidum: because an oracle had declared that Danae's son should
slay him. 7. risissent: fore enim . . . ‘laughed at Acrisius, for
’ (they said to themselves) that the way would be safe and open when the god
was changed to gold.' The transition to oratio obliqua at fore marks clearly
in the Latin that what follows represents the thoughts or words of Jupiter and
Venus. Iuppiter et Venus risissent: contrary to Horace's rule (cf. 2.
13. 38 n.) the verb is plural, clearly because Jupiter and Venus are acting
together—they are in a conspiracy.

8. converso . . . deo. Horace gives a half humorous‚ half rationalistic
interpretation of the legend of Jupiter descending in a shower of gold. 9.
per medios . . . i.e. it can penetrate a palace ; so perrumpere saxa of
breaking into a fortress. 10. amat: φιλεῖ, ‘ loves t0‚' ‘is wont.’ 11.
concidit . . . Polynices bribed Eriphyle to induce her husband Amphiaraus
to accompany the expedition of the Seven against Thebes, in which he perished.
Notice in lines 9-16 how the connexion of thought is kept up by placing emphatic
and guiding words in prominent positions‚ e.g. aurum, concidit, lucrum, dvffidit.
subruit, muneribus, munera, all of which refer either to ‘ gold ' or the ‘ power
of gold.'

13. urbium, e. 9. Potidaea, Olynthus, Amphipolis. 14. vir Macedo.
Philip ΙΙ., father of Alexander the Great, reigned B.c. 359-336. He said that
no fortress was impregnable up to which an ass laden with gold could be
driven (Cic. ad Att. 1. 16), and his bribery of Greek statesmen is the constant
theme of the wax-nings of Demosthenes. Juvenal 12. 47 calls him callidus
emptor Olynthi. subruit, ‘undermined.’ 15. reges, ey. Cersobleptes
king of the Thracians. muneribus3 munera: 1. 2. 4 n. 16.
saevos . . . ‘the bluff sea-captain ' whom Horace has in mind is said to be
Menas, who was admiral of Sex. Pompeius and twice deserted him.

18. maiorumque fames, ‘and the hunger for more '; different from
cura ‘ anxiety ' about losing what we have. Cf. Virg. Aen. 3. 57 auri sacra
fames iure . . . ‘ rightly have I shrunk from exalting myself before the
world's gaze.' 19. tollere verticem expresses ostentatious pride ; cf. l. 1.
36 ; 1. 18. 15. conspicuum is proleptic. 20. equitum decus. Very
emphatic. Maecenas consistently preferred the reality of influence to the
possession of splendid and empty titleS, and remained through life a simple
eques. Horace therefore by adding these two words skilfully suggests that
he is only imitating the wise example of his benefactor 3 cf. 1. 20. 5.

22. nil cupientium . . . The contented (nil cupientium) and the avari-
