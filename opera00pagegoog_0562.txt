534 HORACE BOOK 1

ferant line 8 ; ‘if you represent to yourself that the continuous chains of
mountains are only parted by a valley which runs from north to south, and
which is therefore not too cold and also not exposed to the noontide sun, you
can imagine how mild it is here.’ 6. sed ut, limiting : the valleyis on the
whole shady, but yet such that the sun shines upon one side of it in the morning,
upon the other in the evening. dextrum: i.e. the side of the valley on
the right, i.e. the western bank of the river. 7. vaporet may mean simply
‘ warms ' as often in Lucretius vapor means ‘heat ' (cf. 5. 1131) ; but perhaps
it is better to interpret with Orelli ‘ tepido vapore obducat.'

8. quid, si ferant: 86. dicas. The subj. preS. cloes not 11616 suggest that
the hypothesis is merely imaginary, butferaut is attracted into the mood of
dicas: ‘if you were to learn this, you would say ' etc. Several good MSS.
omit si and have et in line 9, and some have quodsi here, which facts seem to
point to some corruption. Certainly quid si as it stands here, seems quite
unparalleled. benigni has better authority, and is more poetical than
benique : some MSS. have beuiyuae ι Lucretius 4. 60 11868 vepris as a feminine,
and Priscian (5. 8. 42) says that the gender was common with ‘vetustissimi ' ;
but Virgil (G. 3. 444 ; Aen. 8. 645) and Columella treat it as masculine. 9.
vepres, ‘ bushes ’ : usually thorn-bushes‚ as in Virg. G. 3. 444 hirsuti secuerunt
corpora vepres ,· but not necessarily, nor apparently here, for although the
sloe·tree (prunus spinosa) has thorus, the wild cherry (coruus mascula) has
not. The wild cherry is indigenous in Italy, although the cherry proper was
only introduced in Cicero's time. For sloes cf. Plin. N. Η. 15. 13. 44 pruna
silvestria ubique nasei certum est. 10. fruge : 11616 equivalent to yla‘iwlibus,
but in Cic. Or. 9. 30 of corn contrasted with acorns z ut inventis ¹fruyzbus ylande
vescantur. 11. Tarentum: the charms of Tarentum are sung of in Od. 2.
6. 9-20, where Horace places it next to Tibur. 12. fons t identified by the
scholiasts with the sons Bandusiae of od. 3. 13. 1 ε but it is not even certain
that the latter was not in Apulia. The name of this spring must have been
the same as that of the stream, i.e. Digentia (1. 18. 104). dare idoneus:
cf. Od. 1. 3. 25 n. 13. frigidior: cf. 1. 3. 3 n. ambiat, ‘ fiows winding
through,’ not ‘flows around.’ We should say rather ‘ so that Hebrus is not
cooler or clearer in its winding course through Thrace.’ 14. capiti . . .
alvo : cf. 1. 15. 8 11. 15. dulces, ‘ dear to me.' amoenae, ‘ charming
in themselves‚’ objectively. Bentley read et (iam si credis), ‘ and, if you believe
it, now that you have heard my account ', but there is sufficient distinction
between dulces and amoenae in meaning, to bear the weight of the etiam ‘ and
even.’ 16. Septembribus horis: cf. 1. 7. 5 seq.; S. 2. 6. 19.

17-24. You are universally accouuted a happy man .· but don't trust the
judymeut of others iu this .· for they may ‘not know your weak points, aud uo
oue is really happy but the qood. 17. quod audie, ⁴ what you are said to
be ' : cf. 1. 7. 38 3 S. 2. 3. 298 ; 6. 20 3 Xen. Mem. 2. 6. 39 ἀλλὰ συντομωτάτη
τε καὶ ἀσφαλεστάτη καὶ καλλίστη ὁδός, ὦ Κριτόβουλε, ὅ τι ἂν βούλῃ δοκεῖν ἀγαθὸς
εἶναι, τοῦτο καὶ ’γενέσθαι ἀγαθὸν πειρᾶσθαι, translated by Cic. Off. 2. 12. 43.
18. iactamus . . . omnis te Roma: for the construction cf. Od. 4. 2. 50
‘non semel dicemus, io Triumphe, Ι civitas omnis. 19. plus quam tibi τ for
the thought cf. Pers. 1. 7 uec te quaesiveris extra. 20. alium sapiente,
‘other than the wise man' ; for the construction cf. S. 2. 3. 208 11. 21.
sanum: the metaphor, as is frequently the case in these epistleS, is made the
main proposition. We should say rather ‘and act like a man who should
conceal a disease ' etc. 22. sub, ‘towarda just before ’ ; cf. Od. 1. 8. 14 n.
