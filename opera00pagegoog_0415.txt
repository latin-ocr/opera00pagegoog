12. We know nothing certain of this Fufidius beyond what we learn from
this passage. Cic. iu Pis. 35. 86, mentions a Fufidius who had lent money to
the inhabitants of Apollonia. vappae, nebulonis : cf. 1. 1. 104 n. 13.

centesimas is- understood. centesimae usurae (=asses usurae) meant interest
at the rate of 1 per cent. per month, πλε. 12 per cent. per annum. Even
centesimae (though a common rate) was thought high ε see Cic. ad Att. 1. 12. 1.
binae (centesimae), ternae, quaternae = 24, 36, 48 per cent. respectively.
capiti exsecat, ‘he strikes it off the principal,' i. e. he deducts the interest
for the first month, before lending the money, just as modern lenders of
money on notes-of-hand. caput: principal, also sors, 16. nomina,
‘the names‚' πλε. on notes-of-hand‚ see Ep. 2. 1. 105 n. The construction
modo sumpta veste virili for eorum a quibus vestis virttis modo sumpta sit is
rather harsh. The toqa virilis was a plain toga (toya pura), without the
bordering stripe of purple which the to9va praetexta had, and was assumed on
reaching the age of puberty. The Lex Plaetoria (circ. 200 no.) forbade con—
tracte being entered into by those under twenty-five years of age, but then, as
now, men were ready to lend these legal ‘infants ’ money at high interest.

SATIRE III
SUBJECT z—-Oharity in Judyiny the Faults of Men. DATE, 37 or 36 B.C.

The subject of the following poem may be summed up in the words of
line 74 aequum est Ι peccatis veniam poscentem reddere rursus. Tigellius again
fumishes Horace with his starting-point. Like all singers, he would never
sing when asked, never leave off singing if not asked. Inconsistent he was in
other respeets also, 1-19. But some one may ask me: ‘ Have you no faults
yourself ’ἐ ’ yes, I have: I admit them3 Ι am not like the brazen MaeniuS,
who boldly avows that he forgives himself his faultS. It is monstrous to
overlook one’s own failings and attack those of our friends, 20-38. Far better
were it to act like fond lovers, who cannot see, who even admire, the blemishes
of their loved oneS, or like fathers who call the defects of their children
euphemistie names, 39-48. This should be the rule in friendship, 49-54.
Unhappily we reverse it, and turn our neighbours’ virtues into faults, 55-65.
If we want to be forgiven, we must forgive, 66·7 5. Especially we should
overlook the smaller offences of our friendS, 76-95. For the Stoic view that
all offences are equal is absurd. If nature could of herself have separated
right and wrong by a broad line, whence arose laws among men‘.2 96-112.
Punishments must be graduated to meet offences 'according to their magnitude,
113-120. ‘If I were king,' quoth the Stoic, ⁶ I would be a Dra00.’ But you
are a king, are you not? according to your other absurd paradox, that the
