438 HORAOE Book 11

epic language 3 cf. Hom. Il. 16. 776 κεῖτο μέγας μεγαλωστί. 40. Harpyiis
gula digna, a throat more fitting for such greedy monsters than for a man.
at vos ε at is properly a particle of transition‚ not necessarily of opposition.
It is especially one of transition to an imprecation, as here, cf. Epod. 5. 1 n.
41. praesentes, ‘ mighty ' z praesens is regularly used of the present power of
the gods 3 cf. Od. 1. 35. 2 3 Juv. 3. 18 quanio praesentius esset Ι numen aquae.
coquite, ‘ do ye be the cooks of‚' i.e. ‘ taint.' quamquam, and yet what
need is there for me to utter this prayer: for, to the sated appetite of the
cloyed epicure, the freshest provisions are tainted already. 43. aegrum,
sick with over-feeding. sollicitat stomachum, ‘ makes the stomach turn ’ 3
Cels, 1. Praef. sollicitare stomachum vomitu. rapula, some sort of radishes‚
2. 8. 8. 44. acidas inulas, ‘tart elecampane' 3 called amaras 2. 8. 51.
The scholiasts say they are called acidae because dressed with vinegar.

45. pauperies, ‘ the poor man's fare.' regum, ‘the rich‚' ‘the great.’
ovis, 1. 3. 6: the modern parallel would undoubtedly be potatoes, in the
respect that they are served up alike to the peasant and the king. 46.
haud ita and non ila are nearly our own idiom: ‘not so very ' 3 cf. 2. 6. 1
modus ayri non ila maynuS. 47. Gallonius, the praeco or auctioneer, lived
about eighty or a hundred years before this Satire was written. For him see
Cic. de Fin. 2. 8. 24 who quotes from Lucilius, 0 Publio yuryes Galloni, es
homo miser, inquil. Ι cenasti in vita numquam bene, cum omnia in isla Ι con-
sumis squilla alque acipensere eum decumano, 48. infamis, ‘ notorious,'
because Gallonius was the first to serve up a sturgeon. He would not have
been infamis in Horace's days, as the sturgeon had corne to be held a luxury,
Cic. Tusc. 3. 18. It had ceased to be so in Pliny's time: 9. 17. 60 nullo in
honore. rhombus, the turbot3 or perhaps rather the skate, whose
figure is really a rhomb 3 the name of which figure is derived from the fish.
Horace means, though there were just as many rhombi then as in his day, no
one had ever set the fashion of eating them.

49. tuto nido, descriptive ablative. The young ones of the stork were
safe. 50. auctor praetorius: the man who first proposed the cooking
and eating of young storks is variously called by the scholiasts Plotius Plancus,
or Rufus, or Sempronius Rufus, or Asellius. He was a candidate for some
office, and was defeated, hence the following epigram in scazons was written
by him according to Porph. : ciconiarum Rufus isle conditor, Ι hic esi oluobus
elegantior Plancis: Ι suffraqiorum puncta non tulit septem ,· Ι ciconiarum
populus ultus est mortem. 51. mergos, ‘divers ' 3 Ov. Met. 11. 795 aequor
amat nomenque tenet quia meryilur illo, edixerit, ‘ were to pronounce,'

⁴ ‘issue an edict‚’ as if he were praetor, like Plancus or Rufus. Of. Ep. 1. 19. 10
hoc simul edisci. 52. pravi docilis ε for the gen. cf. Od. 1. 15. 24 n. For
the sentiment, cf. Ep. 1. 19. 173 Juv. 14. 40 quoniam dociles imitandis Ι
turpibus ac pravis omnes sumus. Romana iuventus z ironical, in refer-
ence to Ennius, optima cum pulchris animis Romana iuventus.

53. distabit z most Mss. have distabat which cannot stand, cf. vitaveris,
For Ofello iudice, if Ofellus is still speaking, cf. Ov. Her. 4. 74 pro riyido,
Phaedra iudice, fortis erat, where Phaedra is speaking, and Od. 1. 7. 27 Teucro
duce. 55. pravum: proleptic. Avidienus, a miser’s name, probably
connected by Horace, in spite of the long A, with avidus, as Sciyana with sayra,
1. 8. 25. 56. Canis: on account of his snarling temper: hence the
Cynics got their name. ex vero ductum, ‘based on fact ' 3 Plaut. Stich.
2. 1. 88 nunc Miccotroqus nomine ex vero vocor ,· Ov. Fast. 2. 859 ex. vero
