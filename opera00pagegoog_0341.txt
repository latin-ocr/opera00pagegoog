Phidyle (cf. φείδεσθαι) 13 1110 type of a ‘thrifty’ country housewife‚ and
for the sense cf. Eur. Danae fr. 329 εἰσορῶ . . . θεοῖσι μικρὰ χερσὶ θύοντας
τέλη Ι τῶν βουθυτούντων ὄντας εὐσεβεστέρους.

1. caelo . . .‘if you shall have raised towards heaven upturned 11311113.’
For caelo, ‘heavenwards,'cf. 1.28. 10 Orco demissum Virg. Aen. 5. 451 il
clamor caelo. The most ancient, and perhaps most natural, attitude of prayer
was standing with hands uplifted and upturned to heaven. cf.11. 7.177
λαοὶ δ’ ἠρήσαντο, θεοῖσι δέ χεῖρας ἀνέσχον, Virg. Aen. 4. 205 Iovem manibus
supplex orasse supinis, 1 Tim. ii. 8 6Ι will therefore that men pray every
where, liftiny up holy hands) 2. nascente luna. The day of the new
moon (νουμηνία, 01. 1 Sam. xx. 5, 010.) was a natural day 101 bringing the
monthly offering to the Lares (mens’tma tura Lari Tib. 1. 3. 34). 3. horna
fruge, ‘with this year' s corn' 3=h0rnus horma-3, cf. ὥρας 311 offering of the
firstfruits 01 1110 harvest is meant.

5. pestilentem Africum, ‘the deadly African wind‚’ the Sirocco, cf. 2.
14. 15 11. sentiet, ‘feel 10 113 0031 ’ ; 3. 5. 36 n. 6. sterilem rubi-
ginem, ‘the blighting mildew': some MSS. spell robiyo, but the word:
‘rust,' from rubea 7. alumni: see 3. 18. 4 11. 8. pomifero . . .
‘the sickly season when autumn yields her fruits,' see line 5 n. pomifer
annus, ‘autumn‚’ as Epod. 2. 29 α. hibernuszwinter, Virg. Aen. 6. 311
frigidus a.=the 00111 part of the year. 9. Algido: a Mt. in Latium.
devota, ‘ doomed‚' ⁶ destined 101 3301111003 13. cervice, ‘with blood from
its neck? 14. temptare, ‘to besiege‚' ‘attackss as though the favour 01
1110 gods were only to be won with effort and expense. Translate: ‘You
have no need to besiege with sacrifice of many sheep the tiny gods you crown
with rosemary.’ 15. parvos deos :parva deorwm simulacra.

17. inmunis . . . ‘ if giftless your hand has touched the altar not made
more persuasive by (sacrifice 01) 3 costly victim, then it has appeased the
angry Penates with duteous meal and erackling salt,’ i.e. the act 01 supplica-
tion is enough without any vain oblations. inmunis is emphatic and, as Od.
4 12. 23 31111 ΕΡ. 1. 14. 33, =‘without a gift,' the hand which only offers
the mola salsa being spoken of as ‘giftless' in comparison with the one which
brings a costly victim. The comparative blandior has its full force3 the
suppliant does not seek to add to her powers of persuasion by a cbstly
sacrifice, and blandus is scornful (01. blandiri), Horace despising such en-
deavours to‘ coax’ or ‘'wheedle the gods (cf. votis pacisci 3. 29. 59 11..) The
apodosis begins with mollivit and the perfect expresses that the act of
supplication at once effects its aim. The stanza probably represents a well-
known Ὑνώμη, ef. Pliny Praefi N. H. ‘mola tantum salsa litant qui ‘non habent
tara. Most put the comma after mnus. ‘though thy hand . . . held no
gift, it appeased the Penates with meal. . and could please no more (non
blandior: n. b. sutura) with a costly vietim’ ·but ‘non blandior mollivit
could only mean ‘was not more pleasing when it appeased! Orelli explains zn-
munis ‘guiltless' (cf. Ps. 50. 13) but that would need inmunis sceleri-3, and the
two other passages where Horace uses the word are clear. 20. 131Το pio et
saliente mica, i. 0. the mola salsa, a mixture of meal and salt sprinkled. 011
the head of the victim or offered, as here, by itself on the altar. mica 13 3

‘grain’ or ‘crumb' 01 anything, here of salt, as every Roman who had seen
the mola salsa would at once understand, saliente, ‘sputtering' or ‘cracklingss

i. e. when thrown on the fire.
