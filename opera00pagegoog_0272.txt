rhythm of line 36 adds to the effect. 37. ne retractes: rather dependent
on quaere (= ‘lest you resume') than a direct prohibition. iocis, i.e. such
light themes as ay. 2. 4. 38. Oeae munera neniae, ‘a task which
belongs to the Oean dirge.' Simonides the lyric poet of Ceos (556-467 B.c.)
was celebrated for his dirges (θρῆνοι) and epitaphs ; his epitaph on those who
fell at Thermopylae is best known. 40. leviore plectro, ‘with lighter ’
quill,' i.e. in a style and on a subject that shall be less grave. The opposite
phrase is yraviore plectro Ovid Met. 10. 150, or maiore plectro 4. 2. 33.

Of Caius Sallustius Crispus a full account is given Tac. Ann. 3. 30. He
was grandnephew of the historian Sallust, who adopted him, and one of the
intimate friends of Augustus ; but, though possessed of great abilities, held
aloof from all public offices, preferring, like Maecenas, the private influence
of a friend to the titular distinction of a magistracy. He died ΑΔ). 20.

1. nullus. A somewhat awkward stanza. Horace wishes to say that as
gold and silver have no lustre when still in the mine (οὐκ ἔστ’ ἐν ἄντροις
λευκός, ὣ ξέν’, ἄργυρος, Plut. περὶ δυσωπίας 10), so Crispus can see no charm in
wealth except it is used 3 but he has partially sacrificed clearness to brevity.
avaris : the earth guards its wealth like a miser. 2. lamnae z any thin
piece of meta13 here used contemptuously for precious metal in a useless
uninteresting shape, a mere ingot. For the syncopated form cf. 1. 36. 8 n.
inimice nisi go together. Grammatically uisi might go with uullus color
est, but would give no sense. 3. nisi . . . usu. This phrase has two
meanings, one literal the other metaphorical: (1) all metals become dull by
disuse‚ and bright by use ; (2) wealth has no brilliancy unless employed.

5. extento aevo: not ‘through long ages' but ‘his span of life being
extended beyond the grave,' ue. Proculeius by his noble deed shall win an
immortality of fame, a life beyond life, as is made clear in h'nes 7, 8. G.
Proculeius Varro Murena was a Roman knight who divided his property
between his brothers who had lost their own in the civil wars. One brother
was the Licinius to whom 2. 10 is addressed. 6. notus animi. Editors
take this as=uolus propter animum, but avoid all explanation, and only
compare 4. 13. 21, which is clearly not to be so taken, vid. loc. animi is a
simple gen. of quality: ‘ PrOculeius shall live in fame (vivet uolus) beyond
the span of life, (Proculeius) of fatherly affection for his brothers.² 7.
metuente solvi, ‘on pinions that dread to fiag‚' or ‘droop ’ ; cf. 3. 11. 10
onetuitque tauyi, 4. 5. 20 culpari metuit, and 1. 15. 27 n. solvi (like
λύεσθαι) is used of that relaxation of nerve tension which is produced by
fatigue‚ sleep, cold‚ etc. ; cf. Virg. Aen. 12. 951 solvuntur friyore membra.

9. latius regnes . . . Note the indefinite use of the 2nd person singular,
‘thou' meaning ‘any one'; cf. 1. 1. 13. ,spiritus (like θυμός, from θύω to
breathe or blow fiercely)=the fierce passionate part of our nature. avidus
