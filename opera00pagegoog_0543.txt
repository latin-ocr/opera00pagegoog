EPISTLE vn NOTES 515

61. non sane=otae πάνυ, but in both cases the question has been raised
whether the negative is strengthened or weakened by the added particle. The
former seems to be ,the case: cf. 2. 1. 106; S. 2. 3. 1383 Cope's Gorgias
App. ii.; Cic. de Orat. 2. l. 5; de Off. 2. 2. 5 haud sane intellego.
62. benig-ne: cf. line 16 n. 63. neget, ‘is he to refuse me2’ Roby‚ S.
G. 674. inprobus, ‘the impudent fellow‚’ from the point of view of
Demetrius,

fs 64. mane, ‘next morning.’ 65. tunicato: the cumbrous toga was
seldom worn by the poorer classes at Rome, except on ceremonial occasions.
Augustus was annoyed at the disuse of the national dress, and forbade the
citizens to appear in the forum or circus without the toga (Suet. Aug. 40).
In the country it was still less used z Juv. 3. 171 pars mamm. Italiae est . . .
i‘n quo nemo toyam sumit nisi mortuus ,· Mart. 10. 47. 5 toya rara ,· 51. 6
tunicata quies. scruta, ‘ odds and ends.’ 66. οοουραῢεφθάνει, comes
upon him before he sees him. prior z the inferior would naturally be the
first to offer a sallui-:gtion3 cf. Mart. 3. 95. 1 ‘numquam dicis ‘ava' sed τειῖᾶιε,
Naevole, semper . . . cur hoc expectes a me, rfaya, Naevole, dicas, Ι nampuw, ‘nec
melior, Naevole‚ nec prior es· 67. excusare, ‘began pleading . . . as his
reason ': Cic. Phil. 9. 4. 8 excusare wwrbum. mercennaria: all good
MSS. here give om, where the first π represents the assimilated cl of mercati,
the second a suffix -on : cf. Roby 942. 1. The meaning therefore cannot be
‘the bonds of buying and selling,' which would involve no merces, but ‘his
salaried dutieS‚’ ‘hireling bonds': cf. S. 1. 6. 86 sipraeco parvas . . . Ι mercedes
sequerer. 68. domum venisset : for the morning salutatis), which would
be expected from an inferior after the compliment of such an invitation.
69. providisset: cf. Plaut. Asin. 2. 4. 44 non hercle te provideram: quaeso
ne vitio vorrtaae Ter. And. 2. 1. 12 erus est, neque provideram. sic . . . si,
‘ on condition that.’ 70. ut libet, ‘as you please,' i.e. if you wish it.

72. dicenda tacenda, i.e. whatever came into his head, with no sugges-
tion of blame, as in Demosth. de· Cor. ξ 157 καὶ βοᾷς ῥητὰ καὶ ἄρρητα
ὀνομάζων. There is a similar asyndeton in fanda nefanda Catull. 64. 405:
cf. Cic. Tusc. 5. 39. 114. ¹74. piscis: the particle of comparison is omitted,
and the metaphor is incorporated with the main clause, as often: cf. 1. 1. 2.
75. certus, ‘regular,' one who could be relied upon. 76. rura, ‘ estates‚’
has the construction of rua indictis Latinis: the feriae Latinae were
not statae but conceptivae, i. e. were held at a time fixed each year by the consuls,
and proclaimed by a praeco. Until they had held this festival on the Alban
Mount, the consuls were not allowed to leave Rome (Livy 21. 63); The festival
was made the occasion for a general holiday, and was always accompanied
by a· iustitium so that Philippus had no legal business to keep him in the city.

77. inpositus mannis, not ‘on horseback,' in which case the plural
would barely be justifiable 3 but in a carriage drawn by manni : cf. Ov. Pont.
3. 4. 100 filius et iuncti& ut prius, ibit equis ‚· Virg. Aen. 12. 735 cum prima
in proelia iunctos Ι conscendebat equo-3. Homer often has ἵπποι in this sense,
(5.9. Il. 5. 13 τὼ μὲν ἀφ’ ἵπποιιν, 46 ἵππων ἐπιβησόμενον. manm' ‘were
small Gallio horses (cobs) famous for swiftness and evidently in great demand
at Rome for use in harness,’ Munro on Lucr. 3. 1063 currit agen-3 mannos
ad eddam praecipitante& Of. Od. 3. 27. 7 ; Ov. Am. 2. 16. 49 rapientibus esseda
‘mannia arvum caelumque, πλε. the fertility of the soil and the pleasant
climate. Sabinum: the shortness of the holiday (six days) prevented
Philippus from visiting any of the sea-side retreats in Campania. 79.
