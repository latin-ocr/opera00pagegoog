342 HORACE BOOK 1v

17. non incendia . . . ‘nor does the burning of unholy Carthage more
brightly point out the renown of him who returned having won a name from
conquered Africa than do the Muses of Calabria . . .' 'Phe sense is clear:
the public memorials and the unrivalled exploits of Africanus have not done
more for his fame than the verses of Ennius. On the other hand the 011380-
tions to the text are many. (1) The burning of Carthage took place B.c. 146,
37 years after the death of the elder Scipio, 23 after the death of Ennius, and
therefore had nothing to do with either of them. Wickham makes a sugges-
tion which is just possible, that Horace is thinking not so much of the elder
Scipio personally as of the fame of the name ‘ Africanus,' eius . . . rediit
being merely a periphrasis for that name. Horace then asks ‘What throws
most glory on the name of Africanus, Zama and Carthage, or Ennius' poetry 2’
(2) Τ118 gen. Kartliayinis inpiae followed immediately by the gen. eius, which
has no connexion with it but goes with laudae, is very awkward. (3) The
pronoun is, doubtless as being weak and unemphatic, is almost absolutely
ignored by the Roman poets: Virgil very rarely uses it: in the Odes it is
only found here and in the dubious passage 3. 11. 18, nor can it bear the
strong emphasis here placed upon it. (4) All the Odes admit of division into
stanzas. As at present constituted this Ode consists of 34 lines and cannot
be so divided--a formal but fatal objection to the text. Some editors mark
a lacuna of two lines after line 17 ; Kiessling omits lines 17 and 33 as spuri-
ous. Some alteration is certainly needed. 18. qui domita . . . i.e. P.
Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major. Cf. S. 2. 1. 66 duxit ab oppressa meritum
Karthayi‘ne nomen. Livy says that he was the first Roman imperator who
received a name from the people he had conquered: the practice subsequently
became frequent, e.g. Asiaticae, Germanicus, M aeedonieas, and cf. our 1188 of
such titles as N apier of Magdala, Wolseley of Cair0. 20. Calabrae
Pierides. Although Pierides (‘ dwellers in Pieria' 4. 3. 18 11.) had
become merely: ‘ Μ11888,’ yet the combination of the word with Calabrae is
hardly happy. Q. EnniuS, the father of Roman poeti-y, was born at Rudiae in
Calabria B.c. 239 : his most important work was an epic poem called AnnaleS,
the principa] portion of which was a description of the second Punic war.
neque . . . ‘nor‚ if no poet’s page tell of thy great deeds, shalt thou reap
thy reward? sileant, ‘ pass over in silence’ ; cf. 2. 13. 26 11. ·

23. taciturnitas invida, ‘ grudging silence,’ cf. 4. 9. 33 lividas obliviones,
26. Virtus et favor et lingua. All with vatum: it is to the ‘ mighty poets’
wit and favour and eloquence ’ that Aeacus owes his salvation from the Stygian
waves. 2'7. divitibus . . . ‘places a hallowed dweller in the islands of
the blest.' divites insulae are the μακάρων νῆσοι, fortunatae insulae, ‘the
Happy Isles ' situated somewhere ‘beyond the simset,’ wherein dwelt the good
and glorious heroes of the past. 29. caelo . . . ‘the Muse dowers with

a dwelling in the sky.’ sic : emphatic, ‘ so ' and only so, i.e. by the favour
of the Muse3 the word must be mentally supplied before each of the two
succeeding 81811888. 31. clarum . . . ‘so do the sons of Tyndarus (ie.

Castor and Pollux, see 1. 3. 2 n.)‚ a brilliant constellation, snatch the storm-
tossed bark from the abyss.'
