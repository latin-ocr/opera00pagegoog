34. Fundos: Fondi, twelve R. miles from Tarracina. Aufidio Lusco
praetore, ‘in the praetorship of Aufidius Luscus ἰ as if he was grand as a
consul, aud gave 3 date to the year. We learn from the Corp. Inscr. L. (l.
1187) 11131 Fundi was governed by three acdiZeS, but Horace is scoffing at the
assumed magnificence of Luscus. Cf. Cic. Agr. 2. 34. 93, where the duumviri
of Capua call themselves ⁶ praetors' libenter z they were glad to get rid
of Fundi and its ‘praetor,' whose attentioris must have been as boring to
the illustrious travellers as the addresses read by modern corporations to
distinguished visitors. 35. praemia, ‘the decorations.' scribae: 110
had been a treasury clerk, a profession not held in very high honour. Horace
himself was a quaestorius sorim,- cf. 2. 6. 36 n. 36. praetextam et

seem to have been at Formiae, but merely to have lent his house in his absence.

40. M. Plotius 'I'uooa and L. Varius, who edited the Aencid after
