486 - HORACE Boou 11

40. secutis omnibus, imi . . . i. e. though every one else followed the
example of Servilius and Balatro, the parasites of the host were careful to
comply with his ’ humour and drink little. Editors place the colon after
omuibus, but H. W. Moss rightly places it after Balatroque. 42. squillas,
‘prawns,’ 2. 4. 58: these were swimming, as it were, in sauce round a
large lamprey. 43. porrecta implies that the dish was 0 large one,
2. 2. 39. sub hoc, ‘ on this.' So sub haee Epod. 5. 83. 44. partum,
‘spawning.’ 45. his mixtum ius 081, ‘the sauce is composed of the
following ingredients.' prima: olives were pressed three times, we are
told by Colum. 12. 52. 11. The 011 primae pressurae was naturally the
richest and best. Venafri ε 2. 4. 69. 46. garo, ‘ caviare.' piscis
Hiberi, ‘mackereL 48. dum coquitur, ‘while boiling,’ the sauce was
to have Italian wine added to it; ‘after boiling,’ some Chian: cf. the
composition of the two kinds of 801100, 2. 4. 64 seq. ; there plain sweet
oil is put in before boiling3 the best Venafran oil was added afterwards.
50. The vinegar must be vinegar made from Methymnaeam, i.e. Lesbian wine.
The line literally means ‘which has turned the grape (i.e. the wine) of
Methymna by its spoiling,’ i.e. by fermentation. The essential principle of
the vinegar (which is in the wine) has worked on the wine until it has soured
it ; cf. mutatum viuum 2. 2. 58. 51. Nasidienus has a discovery to boast
of, like Catius' preceptor, 2. 4. 74. It consists of boiling with the other
ingredients (incoquere) erucas, ‘rockets ' (and these must be green and fresh),
and inulas, ‘elecampane.' 52. incoquere, ‘boil in the sauce.’ Curtillus
claims, and is allowed, a niche in the temple of culinary fame. His invention
was to boil in the sauce sea-urchins without washing them (inlutos), so as to
retain the ‘liquor.’ 53. ut melius muria quod . . . ε explanatory of
inlutos, ‘inasmuch as that which the sea-shell itself yields is better than the
fish-pickle quuor.’ In Catius’ sauce, 2. 4. 65„ muria is 011 ingredient:
Curtillus’ invention makes it unnecessary. ut melius = ὡς κρεῖσσον ὄν.
muria : 2. 4. 65. quodzid quod. remittit : ‘cf. 2. 4. 69.

54. aulaea, ‘hangings’3 cf. Od. 3. 29. 15 siue aulaeis et ostro. These
were hung from the walls, like tapestry, merely for decoration ; cf. Val. Max.
9. 1. 5 Attalicis aulaeis contectos parietes, See Illustration in Becker's Charicles,
319 ; Marquardt, Privatlebeu, ed. 2, 311. 56. The Campanian level
plains were dry and dusty. 58. erigimur, ‘we regain courage‚' 0 common
use of the word. tolleret, ‘cheered up,' in 61 1108 1110 same metaphor.
Rufus x Nasidienus Rufus, the host. 59. flere : instead of cheerfully
apologising, he cried as if his heart would break. The dramatic infin. gives a
mock-heroic tone, cf. vertere 35 ; note too the position of the word. 62. ut
semper, ‘ how you will always make game of human affairs ’⁸3 cf. Od. 3. 29.
49, aud for ut qaudes 2. 6. 54.

63. mappa, which he stuffed in his mouth. Horace does not give any
hint as 10 Maecenas' behaviour. It was probably that of 0 polite gentleman.
64. 1108οε 1. 6. 5. 65. 00, ‘on that account,’ 1. 3. 30. 67. tene: addressed
to Nasidienus. ego is part of Balatro's raillery. Nasidienus did not go to
such trouble for men of Balatro’s mark. 68. It will give sting to Balatro’s
remarks if we suppose all the anxious care of Nasidienus was vain ; that the

bread was really burnt‚ and so forth. 72. agaso ε a clumsy groom pressed

10 wait at table, who, we may suppose, removing the patina, 1018 11 drop.
75. tibi di . . . a common formula of blessing3 Plaut. Mil. 4. 2. 47 di tibi

deut quaecamque optes ; Stich. 3. 2. 15 di deut quae velia 76. Nasidienus
