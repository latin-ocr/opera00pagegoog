X HORACE

everywhere exhibits a hearty admiration for that strong, sober,
sels-sacrificing ‘ manliness' (virtus) which had made a ‘ 1666 01
1118116 801111618 ’ 1 the conquerors of the world, but which is
certainly Stoical rather than Epicurean. The fact is that 116 8618
111116 81016 by logical consistency 61111 writes according to the
changing phases of his own mood. He denies the interference of
the gods in human 6116118,2 01 66118 811611 teaching the ‘ wisdom 01

writes an Ode to Pyrrha or a wine-jar and 1311611 1168061118 011 1116
advantages of hard 1616 61111 116111 exercise with apparently equal
enthusiasm. Such inconsistency 18 60111111011 61111 almost 6 part
of human nature, and it 18 0116 01 1116 611611118 01 Horace that he
does not endeavour 130 conceal it. At the 861116 1311116, because he
does not play 13116 Ρ11111611 01 assume the solemn countenance 4 01

as a voluptuary. Those who choose may discuss with seriousness
the exact contents 01 1118 66Π61, 01 find in the Odes which he
addresses to Lydia, Pyrrha, and their kind a history 01 1118 own

man who amid all the temptations 01 Rome could make a simple
country 1116 1118 111661, 68 Ηο1666 did, was not a vicious man 3 the

not a vain man 3 the man whom Augustus asked to be his private
secretary was not a 10011811 111611 3 and there must have been some-
thing very loveable and very remarkable in one whom MaecenaS,
after an unbroken intimacy of thirty yearS, could commend to his
master on his death-bed with the words—‘ Horati Flacci ut mei

He describes himself when in his forty-fourth year as being
‘ of small stature, prematurely gray, fond of sunshine‚ quick of
temper and quickly appeased.' ⁵ Suetonius says that he was
‘short and stout’ ⁶ and quotes a letter of Augustus in which the
emperor, acknowledging the receipt of one of his books, says that
the poet seems afraid that his book will be bigger 111611 himself,
but reminds him that though not tall still he has a ‘ corporation'
