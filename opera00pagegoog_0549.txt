this familiar story is said to have been invented by Stesichorus, in order
to warn the people of Himera not to place themselves in the power -of
Phalaris (Arist. Rhet. 2. 20. 5). 35. 11111ιοτεῆττων, 33 meliorzxpetrrwv.
36. opeS, ‘help,' cf. 2. 2. 136 11. 37. victor violens: the adj. em-
phasises his conduct when victorious as violent and outrageous, and so glaringly
in contrast with his former lack of spirit. Haupt (followed by Munro and
L. Miiller) conjectured victo ridens. 40. inprobae, ‘ in his greed.’

42. olim2 of any indefinite time, cf. S. 1. 1. 25 11. 43. uret, ‘ will
gall ’ ; cf. 1. 13. 6 ; Prop. 4. (5.) 3. 23 num teneros urit loo-ica lacertos? so uri,
‘to smart,’ 1. 16. 47. Α3 111 1. 1. 2; 7. 74, etc. the main thought and the
comparison are blended in the form of the expression. If a man has a fortune
too large for his position and needs, he will be led into extravagance and so
ruined ; if he has too small 3 0110, 110 will be pinched. 44. laetus, ‘ if you
are well pleased with your lot ' : vives is the future after an expression,
cquivalent to a hypothetical clause, analogous to the subjunctives 111 Roby
15343 but dimittes is equivalent to 311 imperative, Roby 1589, S. Gr. 665
(b). 46. cessare: 1. 7. 57. 48. tortum digna sequi . . .
funem: the general meaning of the metaphor is plain enough: its exact
reference has been much disputed. Various commentators have thought of a
prisoner led by his captor, an animal led to sacrifice, a rope wound round a
windlass, a tow-rope, the ‘tug of war.’ As tortus is a standing epithet of a
rope (Virg. Aen. 4. 575; Ov. Met. 3. 679; Pers. 5. 146), no special force
need be assigned to it here: hence the first or second view is the simplest.
Wickham, however, makes tortum emphatic by position, and refers it to the
turning of a rope on a windlass. 49. dictabam: the epistolary past
imperfect, used from the point of view of the recipient, Roby 1468, S. G.
604. putre, ‘crumbling’: an extant inscription refers to the restoration
of this very temple, ‘ (vetus)tate dilapsam‚' by Vespasian3 and the ruins of
the temple have been discovered. Vacunae ε the name of a Sabine goddess
very variously identified. Acron quotes Varro as identisying her with Victoria ;
others compared her with Minerva, Bellona, Diana, Ceres or VenuS‚ so little
did her attributes suit any goddess in particular. The fact that Vespasian in
restoring her temple dedicated it to Victoria proves that this identification
became the official one. But Horace is here playing on an assumed connexion
of her name with vacare, as the patron goddess of holidays. 50. excepto :
