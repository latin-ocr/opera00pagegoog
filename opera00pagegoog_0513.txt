εει-11111 vm NOTES 485

semel mean the same thing from different points of view, namely, that Porcius
swallows his cakes whole. simul would lead us to think of the cake not
broken, as was usual, into fragments, but swallowed whole. semel would

refer to the one gulp made by Porcius.

25. ad hoc, qui : for ad hoe, ‘for this purpose‚’ taken up by a
relative, cf. 2. 6. 423 2. 1. 37. Why Nasidienus gave Nomentanus his seat
next Maecenas is obscure ; perhaps for the reason indicated in this line, that
he could better there point out to Maecenas what might escape his notice.
26. indice, the forefmger ; the other fingers were called medius (or famosus
or infamis), medicae, minimus, cetera turba, nos, inquam probably
refer to the occupants of the summus lectus. Nasidienus only cared about
Maecenas and his umbrae3 so Nomentanus is posted next to them, to point
out to them what was good. ⁶ We, on our couch,' says Fundanius, ‘had to
get on as best we could.’ 28. celantia, ‘hiding,' not merely ‘ containing ’ :
there is some irony in the word ; they would expect the ordinary flavour, but
are disappointed. The neuter is regularly used when a plural adj. connects
things of different genders; see Madv. 214 Β. 29. ut vel continuo
patuit, ‘ as at once became apparent,' i. e. the strange flavour of the viands.
The odour of the passer and of the ilia rhombi was enough to convince Fundanius
of this, without tasting them (ingustata). The nom. to porreoeerat is probably
‘ our host.' It was Nasidienus who held out the plaice (passer) and the
turbot to Fundanius: this is also shown by melimela me docuit rubere, for
these subtle disquisitions belong to Nasidienus all through the Satire. Kiess-
ling explains ‘as for instance (vet, cf. 1. 6. 105) was at once made apparent
when he (2 Nomentanus) had handed to me a dish that I refused to taste,’
not having any idea what it was. The passage is very obscure.

31. melimela, honey apples, formerly called mustea: Varr. R. R. 1. 59.
minorem ad lunam delecta, ‘ gathered by the light of a waning moon ’ ;
not merely gathered when the moon is on the wane, for ad lunam always
means by moonlight. Virg. Aen. 4. 513 messae ad lunam,· Juv. 10. 21 ad
lunam motae trepidabis arundinis umbram ,· cf. 2. 4. 30. 32. hoc: their
being gathered so. ipso, i. e. from Nasidienus. 34. damnose bibimus,
¹ drink him bankruptssff moriemur inulti: an epic phrase. Virg. Aen. 2.
670 numquam ommes hodie moriemur inulti, 4. 659. Vibidius means': Nasidienus
is killing us with his vulgarity, poisoning us with his bad cookery: let us
have revenge before we die. 35. calices poscit maiores: to call for
larger cups was not unusual with hard drinkers 3 generally, however, after
the second course was put on the table. Cf. Epocl. 9. 33 capaciores affer huc,
puer, scyphos ,· Cic. Verr. 2. 1. 26. 66 poscunt maioribus poculis, ver-
tere ε Eur. Med. 1168 χροίαν ἀλλάξασα. 36. parochi, ‘our caterer,’ ‘ our
messman ' ε see on 1. 5. 46 ; here a contemptuous expression for their host.
37. vel quod . . . He fears, as a parvenu might, what language his guests
might use to himself when they began to express their real thoughtS‚ or else
that they would dull the sensibility of their palate to the flavour of his dishes.
Palmer and Orelli say that his real reason is that he could not bear to see his
good wine drunk freely. So too, they say, line 17, 116 brags of his Alban and
other wines, but does not produce them ; cf. too lines 40, 81. 39. inver-
tunt, ‘tilt into ' ε cf. Lucil. 113 vertitur oenophoris fundusx, sententia nobis ;
Virg. Aen. 9. 165 vertunt crateras aenos, which is taken from Ennius. Alli-
fanis: sc. scyphis, large earthenware cups made at Allifae, in Samnium.

vinaria, ‘ decant-ers!
