608 HORACE ΑΕΒ

became very differently constituted; until Pratinas of Phlius, a contem-
porary of Aeschylus, restored the chorus of satyrs, and wrote plays for
them, which were the beginning of a new satyric drama. Satyros
nudavit: introduced a chorus of naked Satyrs, i.e. began to write ‘satyric
dramas.' These were a sort of afterpieces introduced after tragedies, lighter
in character and distinguished by a chorus of satyrs. The only extant
specimen is the Cyclops of Euripides. The length at which Horace discusses
the satyric drama, which is commonly supposed to have been unknown to
Roman literature, and took a subordinate place in Gk„ is rather remarkable.
The grammarian Diomedes, however, describes the well-known Atellanae
fabulae as similes Satyrieis fabulis Graecis, and Horace may be thinking of
these. Porphyrion says hoc est .· satyrica (2=bur1esques) coeperunt seribere,
ut Pomponius Atalanten vel Sisyphon vel Ariadnen. asper, ‘roughly,'
‘ coarsely.' 222. incolumi gravitate, ‘without any sacrifice of dignity,'
sc. of the tragic characters who were introduced at the same time ;—there is
nothing comic in the character of Odysseus in the Cyclops of Euripides: nor
apparently in that of Herakles in the Syleus. Perhaps, however, we should
explain ‘without sacrificing his own dignity as a tragic poet.'

223. morandus: spectator yrala erat novitate retinendus, qui veniebat
post sacrificia iam pransus, iam potus-Acron. 224. functusque sacris:
dramatic representations at the Dionysiae festivals began very early in the
morning, but Horace’s language here implies that the satyric dramas were
played towards the evening, a view which is inconsistent with the prevalent
opinion that plays were produced in tetralogies, a satyric drama coming after
each tragic trilogy. Thai satyric dramas, however, frequently were played
independently is clear from the statement of Suidas that Pratinas wrote fifty
plays, of which thirty-two were satyric. We do not know when the sacrificeS,
with which a banquet was always associated, were offered ε perhaps during the
interval for the second or later ἄριστον (Bergk 3. 31), which may have come
between the tragedies and the satyric dramaS. At the Dionysia it was con-
sidered the duty of all loyal worshippers of the deity to drink freely, ‘and
reeling own thc mighty wine-god's power ' (Becker, Charicles 178); cf. Plato,
Leg. 6. 775 πίνειν δὲ εἰς μέθην οὔτε ἄλλοθί που πρέπει, πλὴν ἐν ταῖς τοῦ τὸν

οἶνον δόντος θεοῦ ἑορταῖς. exlex, i.e. ready to defy all laws, with no re-
ference to any special enactment.

225-233. But in the satyric drama care must be taken thal the lanyuaye is
not low, or on the other hand bombastic. 225. ita . . . ne, ⁴ only so far as
not to ': less common than ita . . . τα,- but cf. line 151. commendare,
i.e. to try to win the favour of the audience for the satyrs, by putting J'ests
into their mouths. 226. seria, the grave language of the heroic characters
in the satyric drama: ludo, the J'ests of the chorus of satyrs: ‘to pass from
grave to gay.' 228. nuper: not necessarily in a tragedy performed on
the same day, though, when this was the case, it would give additional point
to the warning; nuper is used with great latitude of meaning. 229.
migret in tabernas, ‘should descend to dingy hovels‚' ie. use the language
common in such places: tabernae usually denotes booths or workshops
(cf. Od. 1. 4. 13) and very rarely (without any qualifying adJ'ective) ‘ taverns.'
230. nubes et inania, i.e. high-flown, empty verbiage‚ especially out of keep-
ing with the general tone of the drama. 231. effutire indigna: for the
infinitive cf. Ep. 1. 3. 35, and od. 1. 3. 25 n. 232. moveri, ⁶ dance,’ cf.
Ep. 2. 2. 125 : sunl enim quaedam sacra, in qwibus saltant matronae, sicut in
