POETIOA NOTES 597

a plaintive tune played on the Phrygian pipe, which there is reason to believe
was especially used in ‘ laments over the dead ’ (querimoniae). 7 6. voti sen-
tentia compos, not ‘ the feelings of one who has gained his prayer ' πλε. of a
successful lover3 but almost certainly with reference to ‘epigrams,' i.e. in-
scriptions placed on objects dedicated to some god on the fulfflment of a vow.
See the Gk. Anthology. 7⁹7. quis tamen . . . εὑρετὴν δὲ τοῦ ἐλεγείου
φασιν οἱ μὲν τὸν Ἀρχίλοχον, οἱ δὲ Μίμνερμον, οἱ δὲ Κάλλινον-ΟΥῙΟΠ 58.
exiguos refers to the slighter and less dignified character of elegiacs as
compared with hexameters. 78. grammatici, ‘ our teachers,' ‘II-e. pro-
fessors of literature, as in Ep. 1. 19. 40.

79. Archilochum: cf. Ep. 1. 19. 23-25. iambOt the word ἴαμβος is
derived from ἰάπτω ‘to fling‚' and denotes originally a flinging, or a verse
flung at another, whence ἰαμβίζω ‘to lampoon.' When Aristotle, Poet. 5. 6,
says of Crates πρῶτος ἧρξεν ἀφέμενος τῆς ἰαμβικῆς ἰδέας καθόλου ποιεῖν λόγους
καὶ μύθους he refers to the change from the mere abuse of the earliest stages
to a regular comedy. 80. socci: cf. Ep. 2. 1. 174 n. Comedy is men-
tioned before tragedy, though later in origin, or at any rate, later in reaching
literary development, perhaps as being more akin in subject to the satire of
Archilochus. Undoubtedly the reason for the choice of this metre both in
comedy and tragedy is that given by Horace, that it comes nearest to the
ordinary rhythm of prose. cf. Arist. Rhet. 3. 8. 4 ὁ δ’ ἴαμβος αὐτή ἐστιν ἡ
λέξις ἡ τῶν πολλῶν · διὸ μάλιστα πάντων τῶν μέτρων ἰαμβεῖα φθέγγονται
λέγοντες. So in 3. 1. 9 he speaks of tragic poets who ἐκ τῶν τετραμέτρων εἰς
τὸ ἰαμβεῖον μετέβησαν (cf. Poet. 4. 18, where he also says that the earliest
tragedies were in tetrameters) διὰ τὸ τῷ λόγῳ τοῦτο τῶν μέτρων ὁμοιότατον
εῖναι τῶν ἄλλων, and in the Poet. 4. 18 he says μάλιστα Ὑοίρ λεκτικὸν τῶν
μέτρων τὸ ἰαμβεῖόν· ἐστι· σημεῖον δὲ τούτου· πλεῖστα ’γὰρ ἰαμβεῖα λέγομεν ἐν τῇ
διαλέκτῳ τῇ πρὸς ἀλλήλουςε a remark repeated by Cic. Orat. 56. 189: cf.
Cic. de Orat. 3. 47. 182. 81. populares strepitus, the murmur which
always rises from any large assembly‚ and drowns everything but the clearest
and most marked elocution. The frequent recurrence of the ictus in iambic
rhythm makes it sharper and more easily audible than a metre which contains
more short syllables. Cf. Cic. de Orat. 3. 47. 182 n. 82. natum rebus
agendis, ‘ suited by their nature to action.’ So Arist. Poet. 24. 10 τὸ δὲ
ἰαμβικὸν καὶ τετράμετρον κινητικά, τὸ μὲν ὀρχηστικόν, τὸ δὲ πρακτικόν.

83. fidibus, dat„ ‘ to the lyre.' The object of dedit is referre: cf. Roby
S. G. 534, and line 323 dedit . . . loqui. The two main divisions of lyric
(or more properly melio) poetry were (1) the Dorian‚ 01· choric poetry‚ be-
ginning with Terpander of Lesbos, who fiourished at Sparta 670-640 13.c.‚ and
including Alcman, Thaletas, Arion, Stesichorus, Ibycus, and most famous of
all Simonides and Pindar: this was public, choral, and elaborate in rhythm‚
and its subjects were religious or national, including the glory of victors in
the games t (2) the Aeolio, of which Alcaeus, Sappho, and Anacreon were the
chief representatives and in which personal emotions were expressed in simpler
metrical forms. To the former Horace refers in lines 83, 84, to the latter in
line 85. 85. libera vina, ‘the freedom of wine’ ; m. the free speech of
those who have drunk much wine (cf. S. 1. 4. 89 ; 2. 8. 37).

86-118. Not only must the right diction (45-72) and the fitting metre (73-
86) be chosen‚ but also the proper tone and style must be maintained. Horace
here begins to deal especially with dramatic poetry, which he keeps in view
almost exclusively up to line 294. One who cannot keep up the riqht tone in
