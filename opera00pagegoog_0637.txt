sacris Matris deum—Acron. This refers doubtless to the Hilaria on March
25111. So Licymnia (probablszerentia, the wife of Maecenas) in Od. 2. 12. 17
joins the dance sacro Dianae celebris die, where see note.

234-243. The Zanyuaqe os the satyrio drama is to be smnethiny between
that of trayedy and that of comedy. 234. dominantia: 3 translation of
the Gk. κύρια ‘proper.’ Cope, Introduction to Aristotle’s Rhetoric p. 282 11.,
writes ‘ κύριον (ὄνομα) 18 the “proper ’' word by which any object is designate&
and which is commonly employed to denote it. It is therefore opposed to all
the other kinds of words: to all figurative, foreign, archaic‚ ·or 111 any way
“uncommon '² words . . . any words which strike us as strange or unusual.'
Cic. de Orat. 3. 37. 149 contrasts propria verba with metaphorical (quae trans-
feruntur) and newly introduced or coined (quae novamus et facimus ipsi)
expressions; cf. Quint. 8. 3. 24 propria, ficta, translata. nomina . . .
verba: ὀνόματα . . . ῥήματα, ‘ nouns and verbs ' put for the whole of
language ; cf. S. 1. 3. 103; Plat. Orat. 431 Β. 235. Satyrorum scriptor,
i.e. if I were to write satyrio dramas: the Greek critics sometimes use the
word σάτυροι 111 11118 sense, ay. Demetr. de Eloc. 169 ἐπεὶ σάτυρον γράψει ἀντὶ
τραγῳδίας. Horace means to say that he would not confine himself strictly
to the plainest language, and avoid so completely the elevated tone of tragedy
as to reduce his semi-divine characters to the level of slaves in comedy.

236. differre with dat.; cf. Ep. 2. 2. 193; S. 1. 4. 48. colori: cf.
Ep. 1. 17. 23. 237. Davus: said to be from Δᾶος, 3 Daciam, the older
name of this tribe having been Δᾶοι, according to Strabo 7. 304 ; the name is
typical for a elever slave, cf. S. 1. 10. 40 11. et audax: so vet. Bland.
though most MSS. have an, which is clearly wrong as only two classes of
speakers are distinguished. 238. Pythias, some girl who gets money out
of the old man Simo in some comedy. emuncto: a coarse expression,
chosen intentionally to illustrate the style too low sor the satyrio drama,
‘ chiselled ' ; cf. Terence, Phorm. 4. 4. 1 emunxi aryento senes ; Plautus, Epid.
3. 4. 62 qui me emunxisti mucidum minumi preti,- Menand. Fragm. 482 γέρων
ἀπεμέμυκτ’ ἅθλιος.’ 239. Silenus, the oldest of the satyrs, and their
leader (cf. Eur. Cyclops), though riotous and fond of wine, was yet always
represented as full of knowledge and wisdom 3 cf. Virg. Ecl. 6. 31 seq. ; Diod.
Sic. 4. 4 φασὶ δὲ καὶ παιδαγωγὸν καὶ τροφέα συνέπεσθαι κατὰ τὰς στρατείας
αὐτῷ (Διονύσῳ) Σειληνόν, εἰσηγητὴν καὶ διδάσκαλον ’γινόμενον τῶν καλλίστων
ἐπιτηδευμάτων, καὶ μεγάλα συμβάλλεσθαι τῷ Διονύσῳ πρὸς ἀρετήν. Evidently
it was not proper to put into his mouth the language of a low and knavish slave.

240. ex noto fictum carmen sequar: Horace has been speaking
hitherto only of the Za‘nyuaye of the satyric drama, and to this he returns in
line 244 ; hence it is best 10 explain carnum not of the substance of the poem
but of ‘ poetical style,’ ‘ a style of verse.’ Then fictum is ‘ artistically com-
posed‚' and ex noto ‘ out of familiar materia18,’ ⁶ ordinary words! sequar,
‘I will aim at’3 cf. Ep. 2. 2. 143. ut sibi quivis . . . Orelli well
quotes Pascal, Pensees 1. 3 les meillewrs lieres sont ceux que chaque lecteur croit
qu’il awrait pu. faire. 242. series: cf. line 46 in verbis serendi& iunc-
tura: cf. line 48. 243. de medio sumptis: cf. Cic. Or. 49. 163 verba
legenda sunt . . . ‘non ut poetae eaequoeita ad sonum sed sumpta de medio ,-
Quint. 5. 7. 31 verbis quam maxim ex medio sumpti&

244-250. If the Fawns use the Zanyuaye os the streete, the better class of the
audienee will be offended. 244. deducti: 80. in scaenam. Fauni:
virtually the Latin representatives of the Satyra Of. Ep. 1. 19. 4. 245.
