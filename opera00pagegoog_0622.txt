594 HORAOE ARS

pudore, i.e. ⁶ with moderation.' 52. habebunt fidem, ⁶ will find accept-
ance ² or ‘ credit.' si Graeco . . . The limitation is at first sight by no
means clear. Why shouldrnewly-coined words find favour only if they come
from a Gk. source? Is Greek alone the lawful fountain-head of a new
vocabularyZ Lehrs supposed a line to be lost, closing with aut si, so as to
supply the missing alternative. But Schiitz correctly points out that two ways
of supplying needful words are touched upon in lines 45-53 : (1) by a skilful
connexion which adds new force to current words: (2) by new words coined
to express new ideas. The second cannot be supplied from the stores of the
Latin language, or this method comes to coincide with the first (as (3.9. when
‘booking ’ is used to describe the purchase of railway tickets) : hence it must
be met from the Greek. Probably Graeco fonte cadent refers to words
formed on the analogy of Greek or on a Greek model, e.g. inaudaoe (Od. 3. 20. 3)
εᾶτολμος, ampullari (Ep. 1. 3. 14) = ληκυθίζειν, dominantia = κύριαι and
parce detorta means that such words are to be ‘derived ’ (ie. coined) only
jn moderate numbers. Others however give ‘with only slight modification in
form,' eg. amphora from ἀμφορεύς, placenta from πλακοῦς.

53. quid autem is used in introducing a statement which removes an
obJ‘ection which might have been made to a previous statement : ⁶ why indeed 2 ’
54. dabit . . . ademptum, ‘grant to . . . and refuse to V.' These critics
allowed a free use of words borrowed from Greek to the old dramatists 3 why
refuso it to contemporary poets? Virgil was attacked for his use 01 Greek
words ε 01. Conington’s Virgil 1.4 xxxiii. Among the words censured are dius,
daedala, trieterica, choreae, hyatu-3. Of. Cic. de Fin. 3. 4. 15 si Zenoni licuit
cum rem aliquam invenisset inusitatam, inauditum quoque ei rei nomen in-
ponere, cur non liceat Oatoni? 55. Varioque connected with Virgil also
in Ep. 2. 1. 247. For the freedom with which Plautus adopts Greek words
in a Latinised form 01. Sellar, Roman Poets 01 1110 Republic 165. 56. in-
videor for the more usual invidetur mihi: φθονοῦμαι : cf. imperor Ep. 1. 5. 21 ;
credor Ov. Trist. 3. 10. 35. Catonis: the modernised form in which his
only important extant treatise De Re Rustica has come down to us precludes
us from ascertaining in what way he enriched the Latin language. Ennius
did very much to fix the literary pronunciation of Latin, and to determine its
vocabulary. 59. signatum . . . ‘give to the world words that bear the
mint mark of the day ²——Wickham. The metaphor 01 coinage applied 10
language is a very common one: 01. Quint. 1. 6. 3 utendum plane sermone ut
nummo, oui publica forma est.

60-72. All mortal thinqs are doomed to change and to perish ; ancl 30
too words. 60. foliis mutantur: 01. Cic. Balb. 31 mutari civitate ‚-
Livy 5. 46. 11 mutari finibu3; Cic. ad Fam. 5. 21. 1 mutari voluntate. In
all these cases the abl. is strictly one of respect, but the notion of sever-
ance comes in. The silva corresponds to the aetas, the folia to the indi·
vidual verba. Bentley suggested privos sor pronos, comparing Lucr. 5. 274
privas mutatur in 1101033, and 733 inque dies privos, with the explanation 01
Paulus 226 M privos privasque antiqui dicebant pro sinyulis ,· but Horace
elsewhere (0.9. Ep. 1. 1. 93) uses privas as :proprius ‘one's own,' and as in
annos can mean ‘each year ' (01. Od. 2. 13. 4 in horas) there is no reason why
in pronos a. should not: ‘ each passing year.' Acron well explains pronos as
declives et cito labentes, instabiles, volubiles. 61. prima cadunt, ‘ the old
ones fall,' the completion of the phrase being supplied naturally ‘and new
ones take their places.' So an old commentary has prima, scilicet‚folia cadunt,
