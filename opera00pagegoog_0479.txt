characteristic of the Stoics, cf. line 97 ; Cic. Par. 1 Cato perfectus Stoicus
minutis interroqatiuncults quasi punctis quod proposuit effecit. qui non
stultus: ‘ the man who is no fool’ ; mm stultus are to be taken closely
together, and contain a positive idea: cf. Cic. Font. 6 quid mihi opas est
sapiente iudice? qaid oratore nort stulto 2

161. cardiaaemS, ‘ suffering from disease of the stomach,’ perhaps ‘ dyspep·
tic ' ε cf. 2. 3. 28 11. Craterus was a physician of repnte in Cicero's time ι
he attended Attica, daughter of Atticus; Cic. ad Att. 12. 14. 4 de Attica
doleo .· credo tamen Cratero. putato, ‘ suppose‚' generally puta, 2. 5. 32.
162. recte est: impersonal‚ cf. 2. 2. 106; Cic.ad Att. 1. 7. 1 apud matrem recte
est. Schiitz says aeyer is the nom. to est, but does not quote any instance of
this personal use of recte est. 163. temptentur z better than temptantur
of many MSS„ as it gives Craterus' reason for not allowing the patient to get
up. The line is repeated Ep. 1. 6. 28. 165. porcum Laribus: as a
thank-offering for freedom from these vices. A pig was regularly offered to the
LareS, cf. O‹l. 3. 23. 4, hut there is also a reminiscence of the custom of sacrificing
a pig to cure a lunatio, cf. Plaut. Men. 2. 2. 15. 166. naviget Anticyram z
for hellebore‚ cf. line 82 n. barathrone, ‘what difference does it make
whether you fling away your all into an abyss‚ or never enjoy your wealth.'
The connexion is this—the ambitious man is reckless of spending money, he
is like a man flinging his money into a gully, and must therefore be put on a

par with the miser in point of insanity. 167. paratis = partis, line 98, cf.
Od. 1. 31. 17sruiparati3.
168. Canusi ε 1. 5. 91. 169. antiquo conen, ‘rich‚ as fortunes

were rated in old times’ ; cf. Herod. 1. 30 βίου εὖ ἥκοντι ὡς τὰ παρ’ ἡμῖν.
divisse: 1. 5. 79. 171. talos: ἀστραγάλους, knucklebones, for playing
chucky·stones, or jack-stones‚ and odd and even with. πεντελιθίζειν is to
play with five ἀστράγαλοι, 01· tali, as the modern game of J'ack-stones is played.
nuces z probably used for boyish gambling at odd and even. 172. sinu:
the bosom of the toga was often used as a pocket. So Propertius says of his
mercenary mistress, 2. 16. 12 semper amatorum ponderat ‘etna sium, ‘ she
weighs the pockets of her lovers.’ ludere, ‘ gamble ' ς sc. iis with them ε
that is to say, play games of chance with them, in which there would be the
risk of losing them—a risk the cautious brother would not face. 173.
cavie, ‘in holeS.' tristem, ‘with a serious face.’ 174. ageret: cf.
1. 5. 90 n. insania and vesania have about eqnal authority, the former
perhaps the better. A scribe would naturally try to correct what he thought
was a false quantity. 175. Nomentanus, the prodigal, 1. 1. 102.
Cicuta, the cautious money-lender, cf. line 69. ’

178. Supply quo before coercet, out of the preceding quod, ‘within the
bounds of which nature confines you.’ 179. vos: both sons are warned
against ambition (ylaria). titillet, ‘tickle ’ (yap‘yaMsew); several times used
by Cicer0, generally with voluptas. 180. aediIiS, praetore πλε. probably
at Canusium-z Kiessling. 181. intestabilis ε incapable of making a will, or
of being a witness (Dig. 28. 1. 18)—dishonoured in the sight of men. sacer,
‘ accursed '-reJected in the sight of the gods. Both words are taken from old
formulae. 182. ‘Vetches,' ‘ beans,’ and ‘lupinos ' mean the largesses of
provisions given to the people by the aediles and praetors at the games. The
words are chosen with contempt, while their ruinous consequences are pointed
out by perdas bona .· cf. Pers. 5. 177 viqita et cicer ‘tmere Zargse 1 rixanti popula,
ποεῖν-α ut Floralia possint 1 aprici meminisse senes, 183. latus ut in circo
