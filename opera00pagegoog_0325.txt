political anxiety which the prosperity of affairs abroad would give a man in
the position of Maecenas, 18. Daci Cotisonis. The Dacian prince
Cotiso had promised assistance to Antony, and was defeated‘by M. Crassus
Rc. 30. N otice how throughout no reference is made to the defeat of Antony
at Actium ι it is of his defeat that the poet is thinking when he bids Maecenas
‘cease his anxiety,' but the laws of poetry and propriety forbid the mention
of a victory which brought no triumph in its train. The same eloquent silence
is preserved, 1. 37. 19. Medus, ‘our foe the Mede is engaged in civil
strife calamitous (only) to himself.’ For Medusz‘Parthian ' see 1. 2. 51 11.
The Parthian monarch Tiridates, who had been placed on the throne by
Augustus, was being attacked by Prahates who had been deposed for his tyrauuy,
cf. l. 26 Intr. sibi goes both with luctuosis and dissidet ; its proximity to
infestus, with the sense of which it interfereS‚ seems awkward.

says privatus=cum sis privatus ε it is indeed true that Maecenas, wisely
preferring the reality of power to the distinctions of office, remained through
life a simple knight and was therefore always technically privatus, an unofficial
simple citizen3 but on the other hand he was at this very time actually 111
charge of the government of Rome, audit would be more than absurd for Horace
to say to him ‘ cease, since you hold no official rank, to perform your duty 1 ’
What Horace says is what any one might say asking a great statesman to dinner,
⁶ Come and forget for a time the cares of state in the enj0yment of private society.’

ODE IX

A dialogue between two lovers, stanzas 1, 3, and 5 being spoken by the
man, the others by the lady. The Ode is faultless in form and finish, and
has found hosts of translators and imitatore. It is called carmen amocbaeum
from ἀμείβεσθαι, to converse in dialogue‚ cf. Theocr. 8. 31 ἀμοιβαῖα ἀοιδά;
this is the only specimen in Horace, but see Virg. Ecl. 3 and Theocr. 8. ΤΒε
rule is that the second speaker should reply to the first in the same number
of verses, and on the same or a similar subJ'ect, and also if possible show
superior force and power of expression or, as we say, ‘ cap ' what the first
speaker had said. The Ode is best summarised by the line of Terence, And.
3. 3. 23 amantium irae amris inteyratio est.

2. potior, ‘ a favoured rival.’ 3. cervici dabat, ‘ did fling around thy
neck.' 4. Persarum rege. The ‘ Persian king' is taken as an accepted
type of wealth and well-being. cf. 2. 12. 21 quae tenuit dives Achaemenea
‘ the wealth of Achaemenes ' (the legendary ancestor of the Persians).

5. non alia . . . arsisti: lit. ‘thou didst burn with (love for) no other
woman‚' πλε. your warmest love was for mc. alia is abl. of the instrument ε 111
the conventional language of amatory poetry, the lover is said ardere ‘to be on
fire‚' and the loved one is called flamma, iqui-3, ‘his flame’ ; hence, just as
you say ardere ique ‘to be warm with fire,’ so you say ardere Lydia ‘ to be
fired with love for Lydia! cf. below line 13, and 3. 7. 11. So too 2. 4. 7
