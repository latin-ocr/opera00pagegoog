ne velut innati triviis . . . ‘ born in the 61316616 and almost dwellers in the
forum ' is simply a phrase for townspeople. The Fauns are not to speak 36 11
they were natives of the city, and so fall into one 01 the two opposite vices of
language, affected sentimentahty, and disgraceful coarseness. For forenses,
cf. circumforanei, subrostrani, Act. Ap. xvii. 5 ἀγοραῖοι ἄνδρες. It is a stronger
phrase than innati triviis, cf. Quint. 10. 1. 55 Musa rustica et pastoralis, quae
non sorum mod0, sed ipsam etiam urbem reformidat. 246. iuvenentur:
a word coined doubtless by Horace, on the analogy of anyurari, auspicari,
interpretari, velitari etc.‚ to represent νεανιεύεσθαι, which is used (1) = ‘to show
youthful spirit? (2) and, most usually, ‘to act wantonly.' Here it seems to
describe an affected sentimental style of 3 lascivious (cf. teneris) character.
247. crepent: Ep. 1. 7. 84. dicta, ‘jestsss 248. quibus est equus,
i. e. the equites. pater: only inqenui born in wedlock had a legal father
(cf. 1. 7. 54 n.), hence slaves and freedmen are excluded. res, i.e. sub-
stantia] citizens 249. fricti ciceris, still a common article of 10οᾶ 111 Italy
(ceciofritt0): cf. Plaut. Bacch. 4. 5. 7. In Plaut. Poen. 1. 2. 116 we have triticum
et frictas nuces, which shows that fricti goes also with nucis ‘roast chestnuts.'
Martial speaks of cicer as the cheapest kind of food, 1. 104. 10 asse cicer tepidum
constat. The Δῆμος κυαμοτρὼξ 01 Aristoph. Eq. 41 refers not only his
favourite diet of beans, but also to the use of them in the ballot. 35&
aequis . . . animis, ‘with favour ' 3 cf. Virg. Aen. 6. 129 quos aequus amavit
Iuppiter, and often.

251-274. The iambic metre oriyinatty consisted of six iambi until spondeas
were introduced to yive weiyht. Itis α metre which must be handted with yreat
care, and the Greek modets, not the rouyh Latin trayedians are to be imitated.
252. unde . . . =‘and therefore (i.e. because 01 116 rapid character) it (the
iambus) bade the name ‘⁶ trimeter '’ attach itself 10 1116 iambic lines, although it
gave six beats (to 3 11116) 110111 beginning to end like itself (i.e. each foot being
an iambus).' adcrescere denotes the gradual adhesion of the name trimetrum
(as a sort of adynomen) to the name iambeum (Ξίαμβεῖον) 36 3 designation of
the verse. The fact 01 1116 11116 being called ‘ trimeter ' though there were six
beats is quoted to show the ‘rapidity ’ of the iambic foot. For Ribbeck’s
conjecture momen 666 Wilkins. 254. primus ad. extremum: cf. Ep. 1.
1. 54 n. non ita pridem . . . : these words present a grave difficulty, for in
the earliest iambics known, written 600 years before this time, spondees are
found frequently in the uneven places 3 cf. Archil. fr. 22 Bergk-'² καί μ’ οὔτ’
ἰάμβων οὔτε τερπωλέων μέλει, and the same holds good for the earliest Latin
iambics. The difficulty is solved by supposing, with Orelli, that Horace is
giving, not a historically exact, but rather an ideal and half-humorous sketch
of the development of the verse, describing its various stages as they ought to
have been in theory, rather than as he had reason to know that they had been.
Iambic lines, he says, were originally pure, and have only admitted spondees
into their ‘hereditary rights 1101 60 very long ago.' The spondee is 'only 3
comparatively medem and pushing intruder. 256. paterna: Ribbeck
cannot get quite clear about the ancestry 01 1116 iambus, and therefore prefers
the conjecture of a certain Dutchman, alterna. This is to miss the sportive
tone of the whole passage, in which the iambus is made to ‘give orders‚’ ‘to
welcome ’ to be ‘ obliging ' and ‘ long-suffering,' ancl to act ‘in friendly fashion.'
A foot that can do all this, may surely be allowed ‘hereditary rightS.' 258.
socialiter: the iambic is ‘ obliging ' and ‘ long-suffering' but cannot carry
the principle of ‘ taking the spondee into partnership ' so far as 10 give up the
2nd and 4th places. Peerlkamp conjectures sertam, sed!
