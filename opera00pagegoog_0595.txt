then adds blame, aud that the blame in the case of Plautus comes in clearly
in line 174. But Horace is here pointing out that comedy, though thought
to be easy, is really difficult, and it is not unnatural that he should at once
give proofs of his position. That his criticism is hardly warranted, and that
Plautus really shows much power in his vivid sketches of character, is not
reason enough for us to reject the view that Horace's words imply censure.

173. Dossennus: Atellanarum scriptor Comm. Cruq. This is probably
only an unlucky guess, as the evidence for the existence of such a writer is
very slight and untrustworthy, and it seems quite clear that Horace is speaking
throughout of Plautus. More probably Dossennus was a standing character
in the Atellan plays, and Bitschl and Miiller explain ‘how great a buffoon he
(Plautus) is in (depicting) greedy 'parasitesff Τ110 former, however, says that
the character is that of a hump-baclzed (Dossennus a dorsi yibbere) sharper, the
latter that of a glutton, quoting Varro de L. L. 7. 95 dictum mandier α nmndendo,
unde manducari, a quo in Atellanis ad obsenum vocant Manducum, where he
corrects the corrupt words to Dossennum. 174. quam non adstricto socco,

Plautus ‘may very probably be true, and is by no means to his discredit’
(Sellar‚ Roman Poets 164). The play-wright sold his play to the magistrate
who gave the shows at which they were acted. Terence is said to have re-
ceived 8000 sesterces for his Eunuchus, more than any play had produced
before. 176. cadat, ‘fails‚’ for which Aristotle uses ἐκπίπτειν (Poet. 17.
