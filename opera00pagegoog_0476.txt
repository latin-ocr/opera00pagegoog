Orelli) after omnes, The Stoic doctrine was not that all men were mad,

them mad one after the other, ordine, ἐφεξῆς. 82. ellebori: ἐλλέ-

tum paria: 100 pairs of gladiators would be a very large number.
Augustus limited the number to be exhibited by the praetors to 60 pairs at
most, twice a-year. The first gladiatorial show at Rome was in 264 B.c.,
exhibited by Marcus and Decimus Brutus Pera at the funeral games in honour
of their father. 25 pairs was thought a large number at funeral games,
Livy 31. 50. Caesar allowed the aediles to exhibit 320 pairs. Gladiatorial
shows were finally forbidden by Constantine. 86. damnati, participle,

remonstrate. 89. hoc . . . Damasippus says, ‘I believe this was what
Staberius being far-seeing had in view‚’ on which remark some one asks ‘ what
then was his view 2 ’ to which Damasippus answers, ‘while alive he thought
wealth everything and so he wanted people after his death to know what he ⁸
