used, according to Donatus, by Minucius Prothymus about 120-100 13.c.;
others say that Roscius first used it. As the orchestra was seated for spectators
at Rome, they were brought much nearer to the actors than in Greece, and
the innovation was disliked, cf. Cic. de Orat. 3. 59. 221 senes . . . personatum
ue Roscium quidem mayno opere laudabant. Aesopus seems to have acted, at
least sometimes, without a mask ; cf. Cic. de Div. 1. 37. 80 vidi . . . iu Aesopo
tautum ardorem vultuum atque motuum etc. honestae, ‘handsome,’ Virg.
Gr. 2. 392. 279. pulpita in Greek ὀκρίβαςε cf. Plat. Symp. 194 B
ἀναβαίνοντος ἐπὶ τὸν ὀκρίβαντα μετα τῶν ὑποκριτῶν. 280. magnumque
loqui: both of loud utterance and also of high-flown distinction for which
Aeschylus was celebrated 2 cf. Arist. Ran. 823 βρυχώμενος ἥσει ῥήματα ιγομφο-
πα-γῆ, and 1004 ἀλλ’ ὦ πρῶτος τῶν Ἑλλήνων πυργώσας ῥήματα σεμνὰ Ι καὶ

281. his, τὲ. e. to Thespis and Aeschylus. Susarion, the reputed founder
of the Attio comedy, was at least as early as Thespis: but ‘ comedy did not
attract attention at first because it was not a serious pursuit. Thus the archon
did not assign a chorus to the comic poets till late . . . but it was not until
it had attained to some degree of form that its poets were recorded ' (Arist. Poet.
c. 5). 282. libertas excidit: παρρησία inpetu quodam suo delapsa estin
petulantiam—Orelli ε liberty of speech degenerated into licence. 283. lege ε
Suidas ΒΝ. Ἀντίμαχος says ἐδόκει οὗτος ψήφισμα πεποιηκέναι μὴ δεῖν κωμῳδεῖν
ἐξ ὀνόματος : this was in 440 B.o. 3 but the law was repealed three years
afterwards. The law passed by Syracosius (415 Rc.) seems to have been solely
to restrict comic writers from taking as their subJect the profanation of the
mysteries. The oligarchs of 411 B.o. seem to, have sileneed political comedy
by terror not by law. 284. turpiter with obticuit3 the disgrace lay
in the fact that the outrageous violence of the chorus had brought upon it the
restraint of the law.

poets : they have even show-n oriyiuality iu the dramas taken from their natioual

288. praetextas ε 011 the analogy of toyata and palliata this word (derived
from the toya praetexta worn' by magistrates at Rome) ought strictly to be
praeteaetata, and both forms exist. The praetextae are defined by Paulus p.
223 M as plays quae res yestas Romanorum habent, and were first written by
Naevius, who composed two on the early history of Rome, Lupus and Romulus,
and one Clastidium, on contemporary history. Two are ascribed to Ennius,
one to Pacuvius, and two to Accius. For the comoedia toyata of Afranius and
others, cf. Ep. 2. 1. 57 n. 291. o Pompilius sanguis ε the nominative for
the vocative in solemn address as in Od. 1. 2. 43 almae filius Maiae ,· Livy 1.

Romani: cf. too Virg. Aen. 8. 77 ; Ov. Heroid. 14. 73. According to Plutarch,
Num. 21, Numa Pompilius had four sons, Pompus, Pinus, CalpuS, and
Mamercus, from whom the Pomponii, Pinarii, Calpurnii, and Mamercii were
respectively descended. 293. dies, ‘time ' and therefore feminine (Roby

294. praesectum : so vet. Blaud. and the oldest Berne MS. for the
vulgate perfeetum, which would agree with quod and must be taken as pro-
leptic after eastiyavit, ‘ to perfection.' For ad unguem, used of workers in
wood or stone testing the finish of their work by passing the nail over it, cf.
S. 1. 5. 32 n. Now it is a common experience that the nail is more sensitive
