9. barbarae . . . This stanza amplifies the idea of medio iri triumpho,
and by dwelling on the details of Agamemnon's victory brings out more
forcibly the contrast with his own subjugation by his own prisoner. βάρβαρος
was applied by the Greeks to all foreigners : it is an imitative word signifying
a person who y'abbers or talks what is unintelligible, and originally only
signified ‘not Greek‚' but subsequently, as the Greeks began to surpass
their neighbours in civilisation, the secondary sense of ‘ uncivilised,' ‘ barbar-
ous,' began to accompany it. 10. Thessalo victore: abl. abs. The
‘ conqueror ’ is Achilles who led the Myrmidones from Thessaly. ademptus
Hector, ‘the loss of Hector.' Latin idjom has a considerable dislike to
verbal nouns, and substitutes for a verbal noun followed by a genitive (e.g.
ademptio Hectoris) a simple noun and a past participle passive in apposition
(e.g. ademptus Hector). Of. 1. 3. 29 post iynem subductum ‘after the theft
of fire'3 ab Urbe condita ‘from the foundation of the city'3 ante Christum
nattam ‘before the birth of Christ ’ ; Livy 21. 1. 4 aozyebant ingentis spiritus
virum Sicilia Sardiniaque amissae, ‘ the loss of.’ For ademptus tradidit
cf. 3. 6. 44 n. In ademptus, from adim0, the p is added between m and t
as an ‘auxiliary consonant ’ to make the word more easy of pronunciation, it
being almost impossible to pronounce adem-tus several times without slipping
in a p sound. Of. sumo eima-p-tam, and 1. 29. 13 coemptos, 2. 5. 14 dempserit,

leviora tolli, ‘ lighter to be destroyed,' i.e. ‘ an easier prey ' 3 tolli is epexe-
getic, cf. 1. 3. 25 11. We cannot preserve the double meaning of tollo here—-
(1) ‘lift‚' cf. leviora, and (2) ‘ destroy.' 12. Pergama Grais: cf. line 6 11.
Πέργαμος in the sing. is feminine, in the plural Πέργαμα neuter.

13. nescias an: a poetical variation of the common use of nescio an
in hesitating affirmation. neseis an . . . would mean, ‘you don't know
whether her parents are not an honour to you.' nescias an . . . puts this
more hesitatingly‚ thereby making the irony more subtle : ‘you could not be
sure (were you to examine the question), Xanthias, whether the noble parents
of your golden·haired Phyllis do not lend a lustre to their son-in-law.' 15.
genus: nom. case, supply est. Many take it after maeret, ‘ mourns her royal
race and the cruelty of her household gods,’ but this involves taking reqium
as a mere attribute and iniquos predicatively‚ which is harsh if not impossible.
17. crede non illam. Much stronger than ne crede illam. ‘Be sure that
she at any rate has not been wooed by you from among the base rabble.'
non is placed immediately before illam to show that however possible such a
supposition might be in an ordinary case, in her case it is absolutely in-
admissible. Notice the effect of illam and tibi in J‘uxtaposition. scelesta,
‘rascally.' Xanthias doubtless was one of those gilded youths who designate
all the rest of the world (plebs z ‘ those who merely fill up ²) as ‘cads ’ (scelesti).
His own phrase is ironically turned upon himself.

21. teretesque suras, ‘shapely ankles.' teres, from ter0, Gk. τρίβω,
‘to rub, polish, finish‚’ denotes, says Munro (Lucr. 1. 35), ‘that the thing to
