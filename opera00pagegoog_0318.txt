290 HORACE Boox 111

1. caelo: with reynare in opposition to praesens divus. 3. adiectis:
in connexion with the future habebitur not: ‘ since they have been,' but ⁴ when
they shall have been added.' For the Britanni cf. l. 35. 29 n. Julius Caesar
made raids into Britain B.0. 55 and 54, but it was not really subjugated until
the reign of Claudius A.D. 43. 4. gravibusque Persis z 1. 2. 22 n.

5. milesne . . . A sudden outburst of indignation, for which lines 1-4
give the ground (866 Summary): ‘Could the soldier of Crassus live in disgrace-
ful wedlock, his wife a barbarian ’ἐ ’ It is simpler to take coniuqe barbara as
an abl. abs„ rather than as abl. after tumoisz ‘ disgraced by a barbaric wise.’
For the defeat of Crassus cf. 1. 2. 22 n. 6. hostium socerorum. Con-
ington's ‘earning his foemen-lcinsmen's pay’ avoids the awkward word ‘ fathers-
in-law.' 7. pro ‘ esc demiranlis cum incliynalione ' Orelli. ‘ Ο shame for
our senate and character overthrown.' curia (l) :the Curia Hostilia where
the senate met, (2)=the senate itself (cf. 2. 1. 14 consulenti curiae), which is
here mentioned as a type of Roman institutions.

9. Medo Marsus : antithetical juxtaposition. The Marsi were proverbial
for their bravery ; cs. 2. 20. 18, and for the Marsic War 3. 14. 18 11. Horace
with reasonable partiality joins to them his native Apulians. 10. ancili-
orum. 866 Dict. Ant. sv. Salii. On the preservation of the ancile which
fell from heaven the safety of Rome was said to depend. Horace seems to

· have known a nom. ancilium. togae: the distinctive Roman dress, cf.

Virgil’s famous line Aen. 1. 282, Romanos rerum dominos yenlemque toyaiam.
11. aeternae, ‘ undying,' in reference to the fire which was. kept ever burning
on her altar. 12. incolumi . . . ‘ while Jove's temple stands uninjured
and the city Rome,' i.e. the soldier acts as though these were in ruins. Iove,
‘the temple of Jove,' i.e. the Capitol, the sign and symbol of Rome's
dominion 3 cf. 3. 3. 42 stet Capitolium.

13. hoc. See Summary. 15. et exemplo . . . pubes, ‘and making
ruin extend to ages yet to come from the precedent, if the captive youth did
not perish unpitied.’ traho: ‘to draw‚' ‘ drag out,' ‘extend,' and a person
may be said ‘from a precedent to extend ruin into the future‚' who describes
01· foresees ruin so extending from a precedent into the future. The emenda-
tion trahenti is tempting but wrong, for trahentis is necessary as a parallel to
dissentientis: Regulus obJects on two grounds, (1) 116 disagrees with the terms
as disgraceful, (2) 116 foresees that the precedent is ruinous. 1¹7. si non
. . . pubes. These words explain exemplo: the precedent would arise ‘ if,’
etc. For the lengthening of the final syllable in periret, cf. S. 1. 5. 90 n.
perirent and perires are obvious corrections. Pliiss puts a full stop after
periret, and makes inmiserabilis captiva pubes an indignant exclamation, ‘ Un-
pitied (be) the captive youth 1’ the description of Roman disgrace which
follows giving the reason why there should be no pity. 18. signa, ile.
Roman eagles. 20. sine caede, ‘ without bloodshed ' ε notice the brilliant
antitheses militibus sine caede, civium retorta . . . libero, warriors who sur-
rendered without fighfflng, free Romans who had become Carthaginian slaves

21. ego (18) . . . vidi 3 vidi ego. N otice the emphasis with which eqo:
‘with my own eyes’ is repeated, and how in repeating e90 vidi the order is
carefully changed, in accordance with the almost universal practice of the
Roman poets, cf. 4. 13. 1 audivere Di . . ., Di audivere, and especially Ov,
Her. 5. 29-32. 23. portasque non clausas. The sign of security and
peace ; cf. A. P. 199 apertis otia portis. arva . . . nostr0, ‘the fields
(being) tilled our warriors had plundered.’ 25. scilicet : from scire licet,
