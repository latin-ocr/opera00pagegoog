392 HORACE BOOK 1

of weighing in a balance is of course present in compenset, and this idea is
more clearly worked out in inclinet and trutina. Many editors take cnm as
the conjunction ; but the mood of compenset as well as the force of this verb
are both against this. For the separation of the preposition from its case see
1. 6. 115; 10. 91; 2. 6. 34; Ep. 1. 2. 6. pluribus hisce is dat. or
abl. It is generally taken as dat„ but the dat. with inclino is very doubtful.
It is better to take hisce as abl. :let him be weighed down, i.e. be influenced
by these, as being more numerOuS‚ if only they are more numerous hisce ε
sc. boniS. 71. inclinet. The friend himself is compared to a balance.
inclinet is intrans.. for that is the best Augustan construction of the verb, and
there is no acc. here. 72. hac lege: he shall be weighed in the same
scale, on this condition (viz. that he weighs my character thus).

73. tuberibus, ‘tumours ' (the beam that isin 1111110 own eye). 74. Ver-
rucis‚ ‘ warts ’ (the mote that is in thy brother’s eye). 76. Horace, repri-
manding the severity with which we judge our neighbour’s venial faults‚ is
reminded of the 81010 paradox that all offences are equaI, and from this point
leads up to it and its refutation. The Stoics will not allow that any but the
· perfect sapiens can ever be free from faultS. quatenus, ‘ since,' 1. 1. 64.
excidi: supply nequit out of next line. Since neither anger nor the other
faults ingrained in fools 0311 be thoroughly eradicated, why 011301 3 100 severe
general law for punishing offences? Reason should have weights and measures
of her own, and mete out her punishment fairly, proportioned to each par·
ticular case. 77. stultis: from the Stoic point of view; all save the sapiens.

80. tollere, ‘remove from table.’ 81. tepidum . . . ius, ‘cold gravy.²
82. Labeone. Said by the scholiasts to be M. Antistius Labeo, a great
Jurisconsult‚ famous for 1113 outspoken attacks on the emperor, propter qnod
Horatius adulans Auyusto insanum eum dixit. He was son of Labeo who
was a comrade of Horace at Philippi ; but at the time this Satire was written
was not more than twenty, and could not yet have become famous for his free
opinions. Others refer to O. Atinius Labeo, cf. Liv. Epit. 59 Ο. Atinius Labeo
tribunus plebis Q. Metellum censorem, α qno in senatu leyendo praeteritus erat,
de saeco deici iussit ‚· quod ne fieret, ceteri tribuni plebis auxilio fuerunt. But
this was in 131 B.c., 30 11131 1110 reference is remote. Bentley conjectures
Labieno: but Labienus, a famous orator, nicknamed Rabienus for his savage
attacks on the emperor and others, is later than the date of this Satire.

83. hoc: nominative, ‘the following’: ill-treatment of slaves was not
thought much of at Rome. 85. concedas: with acc. of thing: cf. Ov.
Trist. 2. 31 sed nisi peccassem, quid tu concedere posses? 86. Ruso (called
Octavius Ruso by Por-ph.) is unknown, bnt Ruso was a cognomen of the
Octavii, Calvisii, and Occii. He had a mania for writing history, but could
get no one to read his works or listen 10 him reading them: so he lent money,
and expected his debtors in arrear to listen to his readings. Horace ironically
pretends great horror at such a fate. 80 Juv. 3. 9 enumerates the recitations
of poets in the mouth of August as the last and worst danger of 3 city life.
87. Kalendae. Money was lent and called in, and interest paid, at the
Kalends, Nones‚ or Ides, the first and last more commonly than the N ones:
cf. Epod. 2. 69; Ov. Rem. Am. 561 qui Puteal Ianumque timet celeresque
Kalendm, Ι torqueat nnnc aeris mutua summa sui. 88. mercedem aut
nummos, ‘interest or principal ’: the former also usura or faenus3 the latter,
generally sors or capnt. unde unde, ‘by hook or crook.’ extricat,
‘ screws out.' 89. porrecto iugulo: as ifpreparing for the headsman’s axe.
