therefore both emphatic. 30. longa, ‘long,’ used by a rhetorical artifice
for ‘eternaL' In referring to any well-known tale of horror the effect pro·
duced may be enhanced by a studied moderation in the use of descriptive
terms; the imaginative faculties are excited‚ not crushed and exhausted.
When a modern preacher speaks of a punishment lasting for ‘billions of
aeons ’ he is not even rhetorically so effective as when Horace speaks of the
lonqus labor (2. 14. 19) of Sisyphus, or as here of the Zonqa senectus of
Tithonus.. Of. too 3. 11. 38 Zonyus somnus=‘the sleep of death‚' 4. 9. 27

Tithonum. Aurora who loved him asked for him immostality, but failed to
ask that it might be accompanied with etex-nal youth, and therefore it was his
lot to grow older and more wasted (minuit) for ever, ‘immortal age beside
immortal youth ' (Tennyson's ‘Tithonus’ q.v.) 31. et mihi . . . τῖε.
‘ and so, to come to ourselves, you are rich, Ι poor, but I may have something
given me you have not‚' and then this is illustrated in the next two stamas,
32. hora, ‘ the hour,' i.e. time at some particular hour, sooner or later.

emphatic contrast to mihi. te . . . tibi . . . te: cf. 1. ‘2. 4 n. 34.

MetreS, p. xix, ξ 1. 35. apta quadrigis equa. To keep such a stud as
to be able to compete in the four-horse chariot races wass as it is now to keep
racers, a sign of great wealth. Cf. Aesch. P. V. 466 ἵππους ἄγαλμα τῆς
ὑπερπλούτου χλιδῆςε Thuc. 6. 15 ; and οἰκίη τεθριπποτρόφος. ‘a family that
could keep a four-in-hand‚’ Herod. 6. 35. equa: the aucients believed in
the superior fleetness of mares (cf. Virg. G. 1. 59), but modern experience is
against them. bis Atro murice tinctae. The reference is to δίβαφα,
‘twice-dyed purple robe8.' ‘The dye was obtained from two kinds of um'-
valves: (1) the smaller bucinum, murem, “whelk‚’' which was picked off the
rocks3 (2) purpura, πορφύρα, caught in the sea and thence called pelaqia.
To produce the true Tyrian dye (the colour of clotted blood, but varying
with the light in which it was seen) the wool was dipped in two different
baths, first of pelayia, then of bammum? Mayor, Juv. 1. 27. Afro z because
the murex was found on that coast.

parva rura, which makes it necessary to give this sense to tenui-3 here ; cf. 1.
6. 9 conamur tenues yra‘ndia. Orelli prefers ‘ finished,’ ‘refined‚' referring to
the special characteristics of Greek poetry ; cf. A. P. 46 in verbis etiam tenuis
cautusque serendis ,· Cic. Or. 3. 52 oratio teres et tenuis, ‘polished and refined‚'
a meaning which agrees well with the derivation of tenuis (the English ‘thin‚'
lit. ‘ drawn out,' cf. tendo, τεὶνω, ταναός), but is out of place here. For spiritum
cf. 4. 3. 24 ; 4. 6. 29. Camenae: the purely Italian name for the goddess
of song (cf. 1. 12. 39 n.) is here used loosely with Graiae=‘Muse.' 39.

as acc. after dedit, like the Gk. inf. with the article ; vulqus is acc. after
spernere. malignum, ⁶ envious ’ of his name and fame.
