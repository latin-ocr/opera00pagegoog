ful in the case of the socii. 23. Sirenum voces: Od. 12. 39 seq.‚ 154-
200. Circae pocula: Od. 10. 136 seq. 24. stultus cupidusque,
‘ in foolish greed ’ ε Odysseus did drink of Circe’s cup, but only after he had
been supplied by Hermes with a prophylactic antidote (Od. 10. 318). 25.
meretrice z intentionally chosen for emphasis, ‘a harlot mistress! Circe is
a type of sensual pleasure, but nothing in the legend attaching to her justifies
so strong a term. turpis, ‘hideou8,' i.e. in the shape of a brute. ex-
cors, ‘ void of reason,' i.e. with the intelligence of a brute. For excors cf. S.
2. 3. 67 n. Homer leaves the comrades of Odysseus in possession of reason
(Od. 10. 239) οὶ δὲ συῶν μὲν ἔχον κεφαλὰς φωνήν τε τρίχας τε Ι καὶ δέμας,
αὐτὰρ νοῦς ἣν ἔμπεδος ὡς τὸ πάρος περ.

27-31. We are not like odysseus, but like the wooers of Penelope or the
Phaeacian noble-9, lazy ancl worlhless. 27. numerus, ‘ but cipherS‚' a
Grecism: cf. Eur. Heracl. 997 οὐκ ἀριθμὸν ἀλλ’ ἐτητύμως Ι ἄνδρ’ ὄντα, Troad.

1203. Conington gives ‘ Just fit for counting roughly in the mass.' fruges ,

consumere nati z a humorous application of the Homeric βροτοὶ οἳ ἀρούρης
καρπὸν ἔδουσιν (Il. 6. 142) ; for the inf. see Od. 1. 3. 25 n.; Roby 1363, S. G.
540 (3). 28. sponsi :proci, ‘wooers’: the desired relation is similarly
anticipated in Epod. 6. 13 Lycambae spretus infido yenem Virg. Aen. 4. 35
aemam nulli quondam fleme‘re mariti. nebuloneS, ‘losel,' S. 1. 1. 1043
1. 2. 12. The close imitation in Ausonius (Epist. 9. 13-15 qualem Penelopae
nebulonum mensa procorum Ι Alcinoique habuit. nitidae cutis uncta iuventus)
shows that the word goes with sponsi. Alcinoi iuventus: cf. Hom.
od. 8. 248 αἰεὶ δ’ ἡμῖν δαίς τε φίλη κίθαρίς τε χοροί τε Ι εἵματά τ ἐξημοιβὰ
λοετρά τε θερμὰ καὶ εὐναί. 29. in cute curanda: so S. 2. 5. 38 pelliculam
curare of living at ease3 cf. 1. 4. 15 ; Juv. 11. 203 nostra bibat vernum con-
tracta cuticula solem. operata, ‘busied,' an oxymoron. 30. pulchrum
εκαλόν, honestum, ‘glor-ioue! 31. cessatum ducere curam, ‘ to lead
care to rest.’ The Blandinian MSS„ however, and Acron read som-num. With
somnum Kiessling explains cessatum=qui cessavit (cf. Ov. Fast. 4. 617 ; Met.
10. 669) and ducere ‘bring on’ ; Bentley suggests cessantem, ‘to bring on the
sleep that is slow to come,' cf. Od. 3. 1. 20.

32-43. If men will nol practise sels-denial lo preserve their heallh, bodily
and mental, they will suffer sor it. But they care less for the latter than sor
the former, ancl are always postponinq the effort ιο live ariyhl. 32. homi-
nem: much better than homines, not only on MS. evidence, but because
hominem occidere was the usual phrase for ‘to commit murder': cf. 1. 16.
48; Ovid‚ Amor. 3. 8. 21 quotiens hominem iuyulaverit. de nocte, ‘ere
night is gone 'z cf. Ter. Adelph. 5. 3. 54 τας cras cum filio Ι cum primo luci
ibo hinc. cle nocte cense0. , latronee‚ ‘ bandits! 33. expergisceris,
in the first place literally, but not without a more general reference : ‘ won't
you wake up2’ For the tense cf. Roby 1461, S. G. 597. 34. noles:
sc. cwrrere. The connexion of thought is missed by Orelli. Horace does not
imply that men never omit proper bodily exercise‚ because they know that
they will become diseased if they do z but says that if they neglect it in health,
they will be forced to take to it as a remedy3 and in the same way, if men
prefer indolent ease to the study of philosophy, they will lose their rest from
the disquieting pain caused by jealousy or love. hydropicus τ of. Celsus
3. 21 hydropicis multum ambulandum, currendum aliquando est. 35. posces
librum: as Horace himself may have done, cf. S. 1. 6. 122 11. 36. studiis
