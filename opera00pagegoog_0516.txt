EPISTLES-BOOK 1

EPISTLE I

Maecenas, as is plain from the opening words, had urged Horace to resume
the composition of lyric verse. If any special occasion for this advice is to be
sought, it may probably be found in the journey of Augustus to the East in
21 B.0., followed by the expedition of Tiberius to Armenia, and the restoration
of the Roman standards taken by Crassus (cf. 1. 12. 26). It would be natural

· for Maecenas to wish that his friend and proteye should not lose the opportunity

thus supplied for a panegyric on the Emperor and his policy. Horace here
expresses tho reasons which had led him to devote himself for the future
rather to the study of philosophy ; differing from the mass of mankind who
value wealth above virtue, he declares that it is only in the pursuit of the
latter that true happiness is to be found.

1-19. Y ou would fain, Maecenas, press me 1311ὐο service again, but Ι have

1. prima. . .Camena, ‘theme of my earliest, destined theme of my
latest Muse' : Camena, one of the Italian goddesses of song (earlier form
Casmena or Garmenaffrom &fleas ‘sing’), cannot cover any reference to the Satires,
which were merely sermones Either the phrase is a conventional expression
of high esteem, cf. Hom. Il. 9. 97 ἐν σοὶ μὲν λήξω, σέο δ’ ἄρξομαι, Theoc. 17. 1
ἐκ Διὸς ἀρχώμεσθα καὶ ἐς Δία λήγετε, Μοῖσαι, Virg. Ecl. 8. 11 a te pm'ncipium,
tibi desinet : or possibly the reference is to the Epodes, dedicated to Maecenas,
as Horace’s first effort in lyrics, cf. Epod. 1. 1, also Od. 1. 1. 1. summa:
ultima as in Od. 3. 28. 13 ; Virg. Aen, 2. 324, for which supremus is more
common both in prose and verse. 2. spectatum, ‘ approved ' ι the technical
term, stamped on the tessera (prize medal) which a gladiator received, after
distinguishing himself in the arena. A large number of these tesserae have
been discovered, made of bone or ivory‚ and bearing the inscription SP. or
SPECT. See Wilkins. donatum iam rude, ‘ already discharged.' radis
was the wooden foil with which gladiators practised, Livy 26. 51. 43 hence
a rudis was presented to a veteran as a sign that he was no longer to take
part in ser-ious encounters. Cf. Suet. Oalig. 32 Murmillonem e lude, rudibus
secum batuentem et sponte prostratum, confodit fewea sica, · and for the applied
meaning Cic. Phil. 2. 29. 74 tam bonas yladwtor rudem tam cito? Ovid‚ Am.
2. 9. 22 deposito poscitur 61136 rudis,· Trist. 4. 8. 24 1116 91109116 donari iam
‘rude tempus erat,· Juv.7.171. 3. antiquo in its more strict sense, ‘in
which I served of old.' includere after 91166118, a usage confined to poetry

-(6.9. S. 1. 9. 8· , Od. 3. 4. 39, and later prose, e.9. Tac. Germ. 2· , Roby 1344).

ludo, ‘the training school' ludus qtadiatmdua cf. Caes. de Bell. Civ. l. 14
ylczdiatores quos ibi Caesar 111 ludo habebat.
