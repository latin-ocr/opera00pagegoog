rom-roa ' NOTES 611

258. hic ·. sc. iambus, not, as some have taken it, an adverb (‘here '=in
the 2nd and 4th places). Horace means that the iambus appeared so rarely
that they were hardly deserving to be called iambic trimeters ; in some of the
extant fragments of Accius there are lines which consist wholly of spondees‚ with
the exception of the last foot. 260. cum magno: this position of the
words, for which Virgil would certainly have written mayno cum, along with
the spondaic character of the line, produces a rhythm Which imitates the sense,
262. premit: ef. Livy 3. 13. 1 premebat reum praeter vulgatam invidiam
crimen unum. It is not of course the iambic but the iambic by as rare
appearance which ‘crushes ' the verse of AcciuS. ignoratae artis, ‘ of
ignorance of art ' πλε. of the laws of poetry.

263. non quivis . . . This and the next line are a concession made by
Horace: ‘I admit that every one cannot tell a faulty line, etc„ but am I 011
that account (265) to take any liberties I likeCC' Note that 263 is itself
versus inmodulata& 264. et . . . poetis, ‘ and indulgence is granted to
Roman poets, which poets ought not to need? poetis is strictly the dative,
but requires to be understood again as an ablative after indiyna. 265.
vager, ‘ am I to move unchecked by law ’ζ’ an : ‘ or am I to assume that
all will notice my faults, and therefore avoid them, cautiously keeping within
the sphere in which I may hope for indulgence ’ζ’ Τ116 latter is the alternative
to be chosen : but Horace immediately goes on to say that this is not enough
of itself. The Greek models show that more than a mere avoidance of faults
is needed for excellence. For tutus, ‘ cautious‚' cf. 11116 28.

268. vos: sc. Picenae. 269. nocturna . . . diurna: ef. Ep. 1. 19.
11. 270. Plautinos: for Horace's opinion of Plautus, cf. Ep. 2. 1. 170 seq.
274. digitis ε the fingers were used, not only to count the feet, but to mark
the ictus: cf. Od. 4. 6. 35 pollicis ictum .· Quintil. 9. 4. 51 tempora etiam
animo metiuntur et pedwm et diffitorum ictu intervalla siquam quibusdam notis.

275-284. Thespis is said to have 'been the inventor of trayedy, and Aeschylus
to have improved a. Cmnedysollmocd, ami was hiyhly approved, until its licence
had to be checked by law. 275. tragicae genus Camenae, zle. a class
of poetry called aster the tragic muse. 276. Thespis (flor. 536 B.c.) was
undoubtedly the inventor of tragedy3 but Horace has strangely mixed up
the origin of tragedy with that of comedy. The bands of revellers (κῶμοι) who
went about the country παρὰ. τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἐπὶ ἁμαξῶν καθήμενοι and
ἔσκωπτον ἀλλήλους καὶ ἐλοιδοροῦντο πολλά (Schol. on Lucian Ζεὺς Τραγῳδός 6.
p. 388), developed into the Old Comedy, and jesting from waggons (τὰ ἐξ
ἁμάξης σκώμματα) is frequently mentioned in connexion with merry-making,
but these jesters ‘in waggons ' have no connexion with the festal choir of the
Dionysia, nor, on the other hand, do we hear of travelling companies of
tragedianS. 277. canerent agerentque ε rather a loose expression,
seeing that there was as yet only one actor, πλε. the leader of the chorus, the
rest being merely singers. peruncti faecibus ora: this was limited to
eomedy‚ where the actors are said to have smeared their faces with the wine-
lees of the new vintage (τρύξ), and hence to have got their name τρυγῳδοί,
a contemptuous word never used of tragedians.

278. personae τ Horace here ascribes to Aeschylus inventions which must
have been made long before his time, probably in consequence of his reputation
as an improver of scenio properties generally. Cf. Suidas ε Αἰσχύλος εὗρε
προσωπεῖα δειναῖ καὶ χρώμασι κεχρισμένα ἔχειν τοὺς τραγικούς, καὶ ταῖς ἀρβύλαις,
ταῖς καλουμέναις ἐμβάταις, κεχρῆσθαι. 011 the Roman stage the mask was first
