SATIRE VIII
A Snob's Diuum-party.

Fundanius, the comic poet (1. 10. 42), describes to Horace a banquet given
by Nasidienus Rufus, at which Maecenas and he were present. The host was
a wealthy man, without the breeding of a gentleman. Accordingly, the
banquet was a lamentable failure. 'Phe host's vulgarity appears chiefly in the
fact that he makes remarks about everything that is put on his table: lines
6, 17, 31, 44-53, 92. 111 this he is backed up by his parasite Nomentanus,
who is specially deputed to point out everything that escapes the notice of the
guests. An accident happens, the dusty hangings falling from the wall, and,
instead of cheerfully apologising, the host weeps‚ 54. But to add to his
vulgarity 110 has a bad cook‚ 28, 68, 9ος 110 has his groom waiting, and he
waits badly, 72. In short, the Nemesis overtakes him which overtakes all
who give dinner parties without the art of doing it. It is a mistake to regard
him as a miser: he has very expensive viands 3 the best kind of boar ; costly
fish, fowl, game, fruit, all suaves 7¹68, line 92, and the best wine. He is a
simple sort of fellow, and does not see any malice in Balatro's sarcastic
remarks, line 75. Unfortunately, our ignorance of Roman manners may keep
us from detecting some of the points in which the awkwardness of Nasidienus
lay; and it is possible, too, that we may be led into the opposite error of
imagining ridicule where there is none intended.

1. ut . . . iuvit? cf. Ep. 1. 3. 12: ut valet? the use of ut to introduce
a question is conversational. Nasidieni: to be scanned NasidJ'eui. The
second syllable is short, if we may trust Mart. 7. 54. 8 aut viqila aut dormi

3. 2. 1 melius auno hoc mihi nonfuit. Like ut iuvit the phrase is ironical: he

the change from da to dic is more likely than the reverse. Ter. Heaut. Prol. 10
