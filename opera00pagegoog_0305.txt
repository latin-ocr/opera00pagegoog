takes it, ‘me the Spaniard shall study when he becomes learned,’ but, as its
position between me and discet shows, ‘by the study of my writings shall
the Spaniard become learned.' Considering, however, that during the next
century Spain produced many great writers, ay. the two Senecas, Lucan,
Martial, Columella, Quintilian, perhaps even at this time the Spaniards were
noted for literary zeal and Horace uses the adj. with strict accuracy. 20.

BOOK III

ODE I

ΤΗΕ first six Odes of this Book are remarkable for their sustained dignity of
style and general unity of subject. They are all in the Alcaic metre and of
considerable length, and all· deal with subJects of public and political interest.
It is probable that their composition was at any rate suggested by Augustus,
whose object it was to appeal in support of his politica] system not merely to
the interests but to the feelings of his subJects (see Merivale, c. 41). Lines
1-4 of Ode I are a stately exordium to the whole six Odes rather than a
particular introduction to the first ; indeed, as the introduction to a single
Ode they would be exaggerated and unnatural.

‘ Kinys rule over their subjecte, but are in their turn the subjects of almiyhty
Jupiter ; one man may be wealthier, nobler, more famous than another, but all
alike are the slaves of necessity. Then eease to be anxious: where anxiety
exists, not all the luxuries of wealthf can procare that scmnd sleep the poor
often enjoy. To want but little is the great secret ,· the owner of huye estates
is harassed by a hundred anxieties about them, the builder of vast villas by the

As before the celebration of the mysteries or any solemn rites the priests bade

profani), so here the poet, as the priest of the MuSeS, bids all who have never
worshipped at their shrine to depart, while he chants his hymns (carmina) in
their honour. profanus, ‘ outside the shrine‚’ is used of those who were
