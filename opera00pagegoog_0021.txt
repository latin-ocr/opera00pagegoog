years‚' 1 ‘ cut down and correct ten times until no criticism can find
a flaw,' 2 The result of all this labour, in Horace's case, is that
his verses seem perfectly unlaboured. Hence it is that they have
for ages at once tempted and defied translation : it seems perfectly
easy to reproduce them, and it is, in fact, so hard that not one
translation in a hundred is more than readable. This is not the
highest praise, for the noblest poetry does not depend on form, and
translations of J ob or Isaiah, of Homer or Lucretius may be not
unworthy of the origina13 but it does show that the shape in
which Horace presents his ideas is of unsurpassed excellence.
Indeed the strength, terseness, and lucidity of Latin render it an
unrivalled instrument ·for the expression of simple truths with
monumental dignity and force : add therefore to complete mastery oi
such an instrument complete mastery of metrical effect, and it is
clear how some of the Odes cling more readily to the memory than
almost any poetry in the world.

He is not a great creative poet; there are few new ideas in the
odes. Some critics in consequence deny him all real poetical
talent and treat him only as a versifier 3 Goethe, for instance,
speaks of him as possessing technical skill ‘ side by side with a
frightful realism‚ without any genuine poetry, especially in the
Odes! 3 But this criticism is overdone. In the Regulus-Ode
(3. 5) there is real poetic power, and the closing stanzas exhibit
true creative genius. In such a line as dulce et decorum est pro
patria mori (3. 2. 13) there is something more than mere
mastery over words, while in such a stanza as

quo pinus inqens albaque populus

umbram hospitalem consociare amant
ramis? quid obliquo laborat

lympha fuyax trepidare rivo 2

⁴ there is ‘realism ’ no doubt, but to call it ‘frightful realism' is

absurd, and if the last seven words are not poetry it would be

hard to say what 18. It 18 needless however to pursue the question.

Horace's own prophecy Non omnis moriar has been splendidly

fulfilled, and the praise of nineteen centuries makes rash criticism

of the Odes recoil upon the critic. His may not be a master-mind,
