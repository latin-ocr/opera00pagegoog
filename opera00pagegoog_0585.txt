sinsus 1 NOTES 55¹7

28-33. It is absurd io arque chat because the oldest Greek uviters are the
best, ii is so also at Rome. 28. Graiorum: so Bentley with vec. Bland.
and some few MSS.; most have Graecorum. antiquissima quaeque
points to the oldest writings as 3 class as better than later works, whereas
antiquissimu-m quodque would have indicated that their merit was in each

case in proportion to the antiquity. 29. pensantur: very rarely used
in this primary sense of ‘weigh‚' and not in its derived meaning of ‘repay ²
by any writer earlier than Horace. 30. trutina = τρυτάνη (the first

syllable of which is long) ; so machinazanxami, bucinazssmcdvn. Cf.
Roby 239. 31. olea: Bentley’s correction for oleam of almost all MSS.
It seems impossible to suppose that intra is a preposition, while extra is so
evidently an adverb. It is necessary then to supply in to govern olea from
the following in nuce, precisely as cnm above in vel Gabiis vel cum Sabinis ;
cf. Od. 3. 25. 2 quae nemora aul quos agyor in specim, where in has to be
anticipated 3 Virg. Aen. 6. 692 quas eqo le terras et quanta per aequora vectum
Ι accipie. The sense is: if we are to be led astray by comparing things

which though alike in some respects differ in otherS, like Greek and Roman
literature, then we may as well argue that an olive has no stone because a nut
has none, or a nut no shell because an olive has not. We may go on to say
that there is nothing lacking to our perfect success, even in painting, in music,
or in athletica. 32. fortunae: Schiitz (who suggests culturae) objects to
this word; and says that it was a very poor compliment to Augustus ‘for
Horace to regard it as absurd to suppose that the Romans had reached the
height of fortune under him. The words which follow, however, make per-
fectly plain in what sense Horace uses the phrase ‘height of fortune! ‘We
have indeed reached the height of fortune ; we surpass the Greeks in painting‚
music, and gymnastics‚' a conclusion which is obviously absurd and contains
no reference whatever to the general condition of the Romans under Augustus,
pingimus z the four main branches of a liberal education among the Greeks
were γράμματα, γυμναστική, μουσική, and (as some added) γραφική. Litera-
ture is here omitted, perhaps because the superiority of contemporary Greeks
was not so clear in this as in the other three. Painting‚ music, and athletics
were alike despised by the Romans until the days of the Empire.

3449. It is quite impossible to draw ang( fiaeed line between the old and the
new. 34. vina: Pindar praises old wine and new poems (ol. 9. 48 αἴνει
δὲ παλαιόν μὲν οἶνον, ἄνθεα δ’ ὕμνων νεωτέρων). 35. quotus: the answer
would have been expressed by an ordinal. arroget, ‘ secures ’ or ‘ grants
(as an addition)‚' cf. Od. 4. 14. 40 11. 36. decidit, ‘has dropped off ’ like
falling leaves: cf. Plaut. Trin. 2. 4. 143 solstitiali morbo decidunt. 38.
finis, ‘limitff 42. respuat: the reading of the best MSS.⁹ and also the
only tense which will suit both praesens and postera. Earlier editions had
either respuit or respuet. In the preceding line Bentley proposed to replace
poetas by probosque, a suggestion which certainly improves the ‘ concinnity ’ of

ἶ the passage, but is not needful. F'or the rhyming of the two lines poetas . . .

aetas, which was one of his objections to the reading of the MSS„ cf. A. P.
99-1QO‚ 176-7 ; Virg. Aen. 1. 319-20, 625-6 ; 3. 656-7 : Gossrau quotes eleven
more instances from the Aeneid. Most of these seem to be purely accidental,
like those in Horace: but in the more archaic poets there are traces of an
intentional use of rhyme (cf. Ennius in Cic. Tusc. 1. 35. 85), and in a later
age Eustathius expresses his admiration of Hom. Il. 22. 383-4.

43. honeste, ‘ with honour,' i.e. he will not disgrace those among whom
