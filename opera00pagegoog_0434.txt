52. Sarmentus and Messius Cicirrus were probably two scurrae in
the train of Maecenas. Cicirrus is a nickname derived from κίκιρρος, which,

crow. The scholiast on Juvenal 5. 3, qaae nec Sarmentus iniquas Ι Caesaris
acl mensas nec vilis Galba tulisset, tells us that Sarmentus was a slave of M.
Favonius, who was put to death by Octavian after the battle of Philippi, on
the sale 01 whose property he came into the possession of MaecenaS, who

the horn was there in reality. 59. quid faceres: a regular expression,
asking what greater things could be done in more favourable circumstances,
when under the present (unfavourable) circumstances so much is actually
accomplished. It is much more common in the elliptical form qaid si. 60.
mutilus (κόλος) is especially used of animals which have lost one or both
horns. minitaris, after quicl faceres, is perhaps better than miniteris of

65. catenam. Messius retaliates by reminding Sarmentus 01 the time
when he was a slave 01 the lowest type who had been kept at work in chains.
On being manumitted he would dedicate them ‘in accordance with a vow to
