princes,5 Deliis: because the laurel was sacred to Apollo, who was born
at Delos. 8. quod . . . contuderit. The subj. is very difficult. In
most cases where quod takes the subj. it is virtually in oblique construction,
e.g. falso queritur de natura yenus humanum . . . quod regatur, ‘because‚
as they say, they are ruled ’ z here however this will not apply. Perhaps the
principle is the same which makes non quod take a subj. ‘when the reason
denied is concepffive, not real ' (Kennedy) : you deny that the man will ever
go in a triumphal procession, and therefore the reason why he should go in
one is purely conceptive and unreal.

10. aquae. See 1. 7. 13 n. Horace selects Tibur because it was his own
favourite spot, and also because he always prefers the special to the yeneral.
12. fingent, ‘shall shape’ or ‘mould’: his surroundings will leave their
impression on his mind. nobilem: proleptic, ‘so that hc becomes re-
nowned.’ Aeolio, i.e. lyric, cf. 2. 13. 24 n. 14. dignatur, ‘is not
ashamed‚' ‘deignS.' suboles, from subolesco ‘to grow up' or ‘into the
room of'=‘youth’—‘the rising generation.' 16. et iam dente . . .
⁶ and by now I am less gnawed by the tooth of envy' 3 on the other hand,
when he wrote 2. 20. 4 he was still the mark of envy, still sneered at as
pauperum sanquis parentum ; cf. S. 1. 6. 45. ΤΙιθ metaphor in dens invidus
is from a snapping, snarling cur.

17. aureae. See 4. 2. 23 n. and Pind. Pyth. 1. 1 χρυσέα φόρμιγξ.
18. dulcem quae . . .: strepitus being usually ‘din‚' ‘noise,' eg. fori,
Romae, valvarum, ianuae strepitus, there is a tendency to take dulcem pro-
leptically here, ‘ that dost modulate into sweetness the lyre’s sound ’ ; but, as
in Ep. 1. 2. 31 ad strepitum citharae curam, the word clearlyz‘music,' it is
simpler to render ‘that dost rule the sweet music.’ Pieri. Pieria ·is a
part of Macedonia, the inhabitants of which seem to have been celebrated for
their love of poetry, Pieris, ‘ a female inhabitant of Pieria‚' i.e. the Muse.

577, ἑλλοὶ Soph. Aj. 1297. 20. donatura . . . ‘thou that wouldest give,
were it thy pleasure, a swan's note.’ For the ‘swan's note’ cf. 2. 20. 15 n.
21. totum . . . ‘this is wholly of thy bounty that I am pointed out . . .'

22. monstror digito: imitated by Pers. 1. 28 at pulchrum est diyito
monstrari et dicier hic est3 δακτυλοδεικτεῖν (Dem. 790) has a bad sense, and
so δακτυλόδεικτος Aesch. Ag. 1332. digitus from the root of ocimum:
‘the pointing thing! 23. Romanae fidicen lyrae : as having been the
first to introduce lyric poetry, cf. 3. 30. 13.
