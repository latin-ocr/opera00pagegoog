of youth.' Horace throughout speaks in a didactic tone as an older to a
younger man. diota: a jar with two ears (δὶς οὖς), therefore the 331113 33

account.' lucro appone=put down to the side of gain, add as an item on
the credit side. 16. puer : while young, in youth. neque tu : by a
frequent Latin idiom, when a person is told to do two things, the pronoun is
inserted in the second 3333 with a view of enforcing the personal emphasis of
the command3 cf. Ep. 1. 2. 63 hanc freniS, hunc tu compesce catena. Here
in connexion with puer the pronoun enforces the command by recalling
attention to the fitness with which it is addressed to Thaliarchuse‘ you are

young: of course you must dance.’

commonly male matus, male fidus. It can hardly be said that pertinaci has
a good 331133 where the girl puts on the air of obstinacy: therefore render

Kiessling gives ‘not resisting,' ‘resisting feebly.’
