spiritus represents as one complex quality what Plato resolved into two simple
ones, θυμὸς καὶ ἐπιθυμία, ‘ passion and lust ’ ; in the subjugation of these two
to ‘reason’ (νοῦς) he placed true wisdom or Virtue. Cf. virtus below and Plato,
Phaedrus passim. 10. quam . . . uni, ‘ than if you were to unite (under
your empire) Libya with distant Gades and either Carthaginien acknowledged
your single sway.' The second clause illustrates and amplifies the first,
iungas being explained by serviat uni, and uterque Poenus repeating the idea
of Libya and Gades in a new form, referring to the Carthaginian settlements
on either side of the straits‚ in Africa and Spain. remotis : 2. 6. 1 n.

13. crescit indulgens sibi, ‘grows by sels-indulgence,’ ae. by indulging
the thirst which accompanies it. ‘ The patient must abstain as much as
possible from all drink ’—Buchan. hydrops=156pw5a 15. aquosus . . .
‘ the watery faintness from the pale frame.' Faintness and torpor accompany
dropsy ; albo describes the fiabby appearance of the patient.

17. redditum . . . Prahaten: see 1. 26 Int. The family of the
Arsacidae to which Prahates belonged had no connexion with the Persian
dynasty or its founder Cyrus, but for the confusion see 1. 2. 22 n. 18.
dissidens . . . ‘virtue disagreeing with the mob separates from the ranks
of the happy and teaches the people not to use words wrongly.' virtus
herezthe opinion of those who are wise and virtuous3 cf. Cic. Tusc. 4. 15
virtus brevi-ssim recta ratio dim: potest. In his use of beatus Horace has in
mind not only its strict sense of ‘happy’ but its popular usez‘wealthy'
(cf. 4. 9. 45); the English word ‘wealth,' which originally meant ‘general
well-being’ (as in the Litany ‘in all time of our wealth ³), has been confined
to the special sense of well-being as regards worldly goodS. plebi
populum: plebs from pleozthose who having no civic privileges merely
fill up the state3 populus on the other hand comprises all members of the
state. Here there seems no distinction between the words, 19. falsis
vocibus. To call a rich man beatus was a misuse of the word. It was a

{iffflargmgsffse when the Greeks called the rich οἱ ἄριστοι ‘the best' ; cf.
uc. . .

21. regnum . . . deferens uni . . . quiaquia, ‘by conferring empire

“ on him and him alone whosoever . . .’ diadema: διάδημα, the blue

band worked with white which went round the turban (τιάρα) of the Persian
king, ‘a diadem‚' ‘crown‚' cf. 1. 34. 14 n. 22. propriam: like tutum:
‘ sure,’ ‘abiding.' proprius is much stronger than suus and expresses that
which is a permanent possession and not merely hired, bmrowed, or held for
a season3 cf. S. 2. 2. 134; 6. 5; Ep. 2. 2. 170-176. Horace wishes to
express that the reward of virtue is a crown ‘ that fadeth not away.' 23.
quisquis . . . acervos, ‘whosoever views huge heaps of treasure (and
passes by) without one backward glance.'

All we know of Dellius is that he was nicknamed Desultor bellorum
civilium from the way in which he changed sides during the civil wars,
desultor being a circus-rider who leaps from one horse to another. The Ode
