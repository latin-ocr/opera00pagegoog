398 HORACE - Boon 1

simplicis pectus vidimus ,· Ov. Her. 5. 45 nostros vidistiflentis ocellos ‚· Mart.
7. 51. 7 είοιίεηεύ absentis nostros cantatque libellos. A genitive is contained
in the possessive, and the partic. agrees with it ε Roby, S. G. 4411), note.

24. sunt quos, with ind„ denoting a simple fact, as 2. 4. 47 ; Od. 1. l.
3 n. genus hoc: sc. scribendi, satire. plureS‚ ‘most people‚' acc.
attracted to quos. People sear satire, knowing their own weak points. 25.
elige, ‘pick out any one you please.' Some object to eliye as inconsistent
with quemvis: but even in picking at random some degree of choice exists.
28. argenti . . . aere: one dabbles in plate, another in bronzeS, for which
latter Corinth was especially famous. stupet: a very strong word like
torhes, 2. 7. 95, both used of the mania of art connoisseurs.· Albius is
unknown. 29. mutat, ‘barters.’ surgente . . ., from east to west,
not ‘from morning till evening.’ Pers. 5. 54 mercibus hic Italis mutat sub
sole recenti Ι ruyosum piper. 30. tepet, ‘is moderately warmed.' The
west is here spoken of as cooler than the east. 31. fertur, ‘rushes’
φέρεσθαι has the same sense. pulvis ε the comparison is to the dust-cloud
of a tornadO. 31, 32. ne quid . . . rem, ‘fearfully anxious lest he
should loose aught from his total, or not add to his estate.' A good example
of the difference between ne and ut after verbs of fearing. Schiitz takes ut as
final ‘in order to,' which is weak, and all but makes nonsense of the passage.

34. faenum . . . cornu. A satirist is like a vicious ox, to whose horns
a ⁰* of ha was tied as a warning that he was dangerous. According to
Plutarch, Sicinius, when asked why he refrained from assailing only Crassus,
χόρτον αὐτὸν ἔχειν ἔφησεν ἐπὶ τοῦ κέρατος. 35. sibi, zze. at his witticismS, a
dat. commodi. 36. inleverit, ‘scrawled,’ used, with some contempt, of
hasty writing. 37. furno : a baking oven, where the poorer classes got their
loaves and pies baked. lacu: one of the public tanks whence the people
drew their water. Agrippa is said to have made 700 of these in the city.
38. pueros et anus, ‘slaves and old women,‘ the former carrying the
loaves of bread, the latter water for washing. , 39. poetis : attracted into
the same case as quibus: 1. 1. 19 n. Most MSS. have poetas. 40.
concludere versum, ‘to confine a verse within metrica] limits ' ; cf. 1. 10.
59 ; 2. 1. 28. 42. sermoni propiora, ‘nearer to prose,’ the language of
talk, sermo quotidianus, sermo pedester. Horace calls his satire M usa pedestria
2. 6. 17, and speaks os the satires as sermones repentes per humum, Ep. 2. 1. 250.

45. And so not only cannot the satirist be called a poet, but it is doubtful
whether his predecessor, the writer of comedy, can. sse construction is
quidam quaesivere (Μένωνι) comoedia poema esset, necne. utrum is usually
omitted when necne is used 3 cs. line 63. 47. Verbis, ‘ dialogue ’ ; rebUS‚
‘subjects’3 both belonging to common life. 48. differt with dat„ as
words compounded with this prefix generally, like discolor3 cf. Od. 2. 2. 18
dissidens plebi. sermo merus: in apposition to comoedia in line 45.
There is no asyndeton3 ‘com “ ’
differs from„ 2210sz ha ,” t.’ at pater ardens. An
objector may say comedy has ‘acer spemin& pointing to the rage fathers in
the play exhibit when scolding their prodigal sons ; cf. A. P. 93, 94. 49.
saevit, ‘storms’ nepos, ‘prodigaL’ insanus amica: a rare con-
struction; amica is an instrumental ablative, ‘maddened by,’ ‘madly in love
with a harlot mistress.’ Cf. Od. 3. 9. 5 n. 51. magnum quod. dedecus.
It was customary with wild young men to revel through the streets at
