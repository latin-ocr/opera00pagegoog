of praise opposed to nequam, combines the ideas of thrift and respectability:
‘thrifty.’ ineptus is the man devoid of taste and tact. Cicero remarks
that the Greeks had no word for it, nor have we : his definition exactly agrees
with this passage, de Or. 2. 4. 17 qui aut, tempus quid postulet, non videt, aut
plura loquitur aut se ostentat aut eorum, quibuscum est, vel dignitatis vel com-
modi rationem non habet aut denique in aliquo qenere aut inconcinnus aut
multus est, is ineptus dicitur. 50. iactantior, ‘ talks too much about
himself.' 51. postulat, ‘his object is to make himself entertaining, and
he thinks that is the way to do it.' Ροεέαίοεάξιῶε cf. Plaut. Oapt. 1. 2. 83
numquam istoc vinces me Heyio, ne postules, 53. caldior: by syncope
for calidior ; cf. 2. 5. 65 soldum3 Ep. l. 9. 6 valdius, and 566 1. 5. 79 n.

56. sincerum cupimus vas incrustare, ‘ we wish to coat with foulness
even the clean vesseL’ i.e. 50 far from calling vices by the name of virtues, we
call virtues vices. 'Phe metaphor is probably derived from the incrustation
left by wine, especially sour wine, in a bottle. Of. Ep. 1. 2. 54 n.; Lucil. 489
incrustatu' calix. probus . . . damus, ‘we have a modest acquaint-
ance, a very retiring fellow: we give him the sobriquet of a slow coach, a
dullard.’ probus from its being the opposite of inprobus, ‘bold‚’ and from .
the fact that it is now and then j0ined with demissus, must have meant modest.
Cic. de Or. 2. 43. 182 joins probi and demissi3 cf. Catull. 42. 24 pudica et
proba. Both tardus and pinquis are terms of repr-each, the latter somewhat.
the stronger of the two, 57. multum: Horace is fond of the adverbial
1156 of multum3 cf. 2. 3. 147 ; 5. 92 ; Ep. 2. 2. 62. 59. malo: masc.‚ ‘he
exposes his fiank to no enemy’3 a military metaphor‚ and not erequent.
60. cum: elliptical ; (and he acts rightly) since he has to move in a world

where envy and calumny are rife. 61. bene sano : a man of thoroughly
sound sense ; bene strengthens praise.

63. simplicior quis et est, qualem. The construction is usually said to
be simplicior quis (est) et est (talis) qualem . . . ‚ but this makes Horace say
that he would gladly interrupt Maecenas when reading or silent3 for it dis-
tinctly separates qualem from simplicior. A translation will show this : ‘ one
is somewhat simple, and of the character in which I hope Ι may have ex-
hibited myself to you, namely, such as to interrupt one when reading or silent
with random talk! We must take et as simply joining the sentence to the
preceding: ‘ another too is somewhat simple (111 which character I hope I may
have exhibited myself to you, Maecenas), so as to interrupi: his friend when
reading 01· silent with random talk.’ 65. inpellat: lit. ‘ push,' ‘ jost1e‚'
here: ‘interrupte rudely.’ 66. communi sensu, ‘ordinary tact.’ Of.
J uv. 8. 73 rarus enim ferme sensus communis in illa Ι fortuna, Mayor’s note ;
Sen. Benef. l. 12. 3 sit in beneficio sensus communis .· tempus, locum observet,
personas, quibus momentis, quae gyrata et ingrata sunt.

70. cum mea compenset vitiis bona, ‘let him take my good qualities
as a set-off against my 16111153 cum is here preposition‚ not conjunction, for
compensare never means literally ⁴ to weigh against,' which is the meaning
demanded by cum, ‘when‚’ but either (1) to set off one (good) thing against
another (bad) thing, or (2) to compensate for one (bad) thing by another
(good) thing. In ( 1) compensare cum is generally used: in (2) simply com-
pensare ; (1) cf. Cic. Pis. 30. 75 nonne compensabit cum uno versiculo tot mea
volumina laudum suarum? ‘will he not accept as a set-off against a single
line 50 many volumes of panegyric 2 ' and (2) Cic. Or. 64. 216 spondeus pauci-
tatem pedum qravitate sua et tarditate compensat. At the same time the notion
