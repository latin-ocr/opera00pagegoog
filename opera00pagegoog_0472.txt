13. invidiam placare paras, i.e. by giving up satire, which had made him
unpopular. We see evident attempts to appease this envy, as in 1. 4. 64 seq„
1. 6 ; 2. 1. 39 seq. Virivute relicta: giving up the castigation of vice is
meant. 14. contemnere : people will not cease 1ο dislike you, they
will, besides despise you. inproba Siren, ‘the bold Siren '3 bold or
shameless‚ because of their forwardness in inviting Ulysses to come to their
island. inprobus .- see 1. 3. 56. For the Sirens, see Hom. Od. 12. 39 seq.
15. quidquid: namely ‘fame' vita: instr. abl. 16. Damasippo: a
well-known amateur of bric-‚a-brac, cf. Cic. ad Fam. 7. 23. 3 si Damasippus in
'sententia non manebit, aliquem Pseudodamasippum vel cnm iactura reperiemus.
17. verum: may be either ‘ sincere,' or ‘sound.’ tonsore z Damasippus

18. Ianum acl medium, ‘at the central Arcade,' where many bankers
and money-lenders did business: ‘ on 'Change.’ All thoroughfares or arcades
(transitiones perviae Cic. N. D. 2. 27. 67) 11118111 be called Iani, because of
’ 1110 double entrance ; and in or leading into the forum were three J ani, per-
haps covered ways, or arcades 3 and Livy 41. 27 speaks of Ianos tres faciendos

in a certain town, probably in imitation of those in Rome. Becker, however, ,

supposes that the J ani were three buildings, similar to the J anus Quadrifrons,
which still stands in the Forum Boarium, constructed of four archways J'oined
in a square, with an attica, or chamber, above them. He thinks that the
bankers transacted business partly in those chambers, and partly below, under
the archways (Burn, ‘Rome and the Campagna,' p. 105). In any case ‘the
middle J anus ’ was the place where, perhaps not excepting the Puteal Libonis,
most business was done in lending and investing money in Rome. It corre-
sponded to our Stock Exchange to some extent. Cic. Off. 2. 25. 87 de qnae-
, renda, de collocanda pecnnia, vellem etiam de utenda, commodius a quibusdam
optimis viris ad Ianum medium sedentibus quam ab ullis philosophis ulla in

1110 metaphor is either from shipwreck (cf. Cic. Sull. 14. 41 patrimonii nan-
frayns) ‘or from chariot-racing, excussus suiting equally with either, see
Diot. Note the sarcasm of aliena . . . propriis and the contrasted position
of the contrasted wor‘ds.

20. quaerere, ‘ to ask ' :⁴ he wished to have its exact description, so as to
be able to recognise it. - 21. quo vafer . . . aere, ‘what was the genuine
bronze in which the wily Sisyphus had bathed his feet.’ In a fragment of the
Sisyphus, a satyric 6131113 of Aeschylus (fr. 229 Dind.) occur the words λεοντο-
βάμων ποῦ σκάφη χαλκήλατος,· ‘where is the brazen pan mounted on a 11011’.ῑ’
Damasippus refers to that particular pan. There were forged ones in circula—
11011, 111011811,-3116. 110 used to try and find which was the genuine one. For
the mania for antiquities cf. 1. 3. 90 11. vafer : Sisyphus was proverbially
