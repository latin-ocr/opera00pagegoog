nari Olympia: a Gk. construction, στεφανοῦσθαι Ὀλύμπια ‘to be crowned
as victor in the Olympian games.' 5101110 pulvere :armum-i. Pliny, H.
N. 35. 11 Alcimachus pinxit Dexippum qui pancratio Olympia eit-ra pulveris
tactum, quod vocant ἀκονιτί, vicit ; Milton, Areopagitica, ‘the racc, where that
immortal garland is to be run for not without dust and heat.' 52. Horace
throws out somewhat abruptly a philosophie common-place, and then goes on
to point out how it is practically denied by the conduct of most men.

s.. 53-69. All Rome is full of lessons os self-seekinq‚ and a man is mea-sured

by what lie lias, but even the boys lcnow that this is not the true standard ; and
we are conseious that the pursuit of virtue is wortlzier than that os money.
54. Ianus summus ab imo, ‘ the whole Janus from the top to the bottom.'
For Ianus, ‘the exchange,’ see S. 2. 3. 18 n. For summus ab imo cf. Ovid,
Ib. 181 iuqeribusque novem summus qui (Tityos) distat ab imo. 55. pro-
docet :palam docet, ‘holds forth‚' or perhaps rather docendo praeit .· the
word is only found here 3 in προδιδάσκειν the preposition sometimes seems to
retain very little force. 56. laevo . . . lacerto: repeated from S. 1. 6.
74 q.v. and rejected by many recent editors. But it is found in all MSS„ and
may be defended as heightening the irony: old and young all repeat the
same lesson, like a pack of school-boys on their way to school. 57,-58.
These two lines are inverted in the earlier editionS, and in most good MSS.
ling-ua, ‘ a ready tongue.’ fides: either ‘ credit‚’ that is, a respectable
position in money matters, though not quite up to the standard for a
knight (cf. 1. 6. 36), or perhaps better ‘loyalty' to your friends, to be con·
nected closely with linqua, and hence not, as Orelli thinks, tautologous
after morea 58. quadringentis: sc. milibus sestertium, the 400,000
sesterces fixed as the rating of the equites by the lex iudiciaria of O. Gracchus.
sex septem: for the asyndeton cf. Ter. Eun. 2. 3. 41 his mensibus sea:
septem ,· Cic. ad Att. 10. 8. 6 sea: septem diebus, It does not seem to occur
with any other numerals ; but cf. ter quater. 59. plebs, not in its legal
sense, but in the general meaning a ‘low fellow.' So Hom. Il. 12. 213 δῆμον
ἐόντα, 011 which Hesych. comments δημότην, καὶ ἕνα τῶν πολλῶνε cf. 1. 19.
37 ; S. 1. 8. 10. rex eris si recte facies: Isidor. Or. 8. 3. 4 gives the
full trochaic tetrameter rex eris, si recte facies, si non facies non eris, The
meaning is ‘if you play well, we will make γαμφέἐξὲηςῖ ; Horace, however,
takes advantage of the ambiguous meaning of recte faoieS, ‘ play well ' or
‘ do right.’ ·

61. 1111 conscire sibi, ‘to be conscious of no guilt' : the use of sibi after
an imperative is somewhat like that in Cic. de Nat. D. 1. 30. 84 sibi displicere,
ib. 44. 122 utilitatum suarum, where the subject is indefinite, although in the
one case the second person, in the other the first has preceded. 62. Roscia

fourteen rows of the 0 νεα at the theatro, next to the orchestra which. was
occupied by the senators, s ould be rescrved for the equites: the law was very
unpopular, and QRoscius was hissed in the tHeEtre (Plut. Cic. 13), but
the people were pacified by Cicero, and Roscio theatralis auctori legis iqnove-
runt, notatasque se (sc. tribus) discrimine sedis aequo animo tulerunt (Pliny,
H. N. 7. 30. 117). Of. Epod. 4. 153 Juv. 3. 153-159. ¹sodes, ‘please'=si
