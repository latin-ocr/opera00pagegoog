586 HORACE , Boox 11

utar: best taken absolutely, ‘I will enjoy what Ι have‚' not, as Schiitz, either
understanding Genio, or anticipating modico acervo. cf. Pers. 6. 22 utar 690,
utar. ex modico acervo: the miser in S. l. 1. 51 defends himself by the
plea at suave est ex mayno tollere acervo. res, ‘ the occasion. ' 191. heres:
cf. 1.5. 13. Horace had no natural heirS, and ultimately left his property by
a verbal declaration to Augustus cum uryaeoite vi valetudinis ozon sufficeret ad
obsiynamlas testamenti tabulas (Suet. Vit. Horat.) 192. datis, i. 6. than
what he actually receives under my will. 193. volam, ‘it will be my wish?

The future 1s occasioned by the preceding futures tollam and metuam: other-

wise the present would be more natural. simplexf open· -he‚'arted cf. Tac.
Hist. 3. 86 simplicitas et liberalitas. nepoti, ‘spendthrift,' cf. 1. 15. 36 n.
195. an neque . . . neque, ‘or whether without being unwilling to spend
you yet do not strive to amaSS, but rather.. ' 197. For ac potius cf. Cic.
de Orat. 2. 18. 74 n. quinquatribus, the‘ spring holidays'(Juv10. 115),
observed not only in schools, but as general festivities, from March 19 to
March 23. Ovid (Fast. 3. 809 fiunt sacra Minervae Ι nomina quae iunctis
quinque diebus habent) derives the name from the fact that the holiday ex-

tended over five days: but Festus (254 M), by quoting forms like Triatrus,
Sexatrus etc. shows that the word was applied originally only to the first day
of the festival, and that it denotes the fifth day after the Ides. 01im21.3.18.

199. domus. Bentley attacked this reading, as inconsistent with the
metaphor of a ship in the next line. One MS. of no great excellence repeats
procul, which he accepted. But this repetition, though common enough in
passages of earnest and impressive diction (6.9. Virg. Aen. 6. 258 procul 01010-
cul este profani ‚· Ov. Fast. 2. 623 ; Metam. 8. 589, etc.) is not well suited to
the quiet tone of Horace here. Some MSS. of the third class omit domus and
absit (not, as Bentley supposed, domus only): but this is clearly due to an
accident, and does not justify the suspicion of Orelli and others that the
genuine word has been lost, and that domas 1s due only to conjecture. Meineke
approved the conjecture modo, but 111 Horace we always find mo‘clo‘, and that
only after clam or si. Jeep, followed by Kriiger, proposed modo at procul.
But domus is defensible. Horace goes back in thought to the costly orna-
ments of the house mentioned in lines 180-182, and says that all these may
well be spared: provided the straitened means are not such as to produce
sordid smroundings, a man's lodging makes no more difference to himself than
the size of a ship would, in which he might be sailing. utrum . . . an:
a startling substitution of the dependent double interrogative for the alternative
hypothesis sive . . . sive, but to be explained by supposing that some ex-
pression like nihil distat was present to the mind of Horace, for which he
afterwards substituted ferar unus et idem. Cf. Ov. Rem. Am. 797 Daunius
an Libycis balbas tibi missas ab oris, Ι aa veniat MeyariS, noxius omnis erit,
where the explanation is similar. 201. non agimur: concessive, ⁶ we are
not driven on, it is true’: cf. 1. 1. 33 ; 6. 29. Aquilone secundo: the
strong north wind, even if favourable, might swell the sails to a dangerous
extent: hence it is here used of perilous prosperity. Cf. Od. 2. 10. 23 con-
trahes vento nimiam 36011116Ζο Ι turyiola vela. 202. aetatem ducimus, ‘ Ἧο
drag out our life! Epod. 17. 63 inyrata misero vita ducenda est. Austris:
the south wind is usually regarded as stormy (turbidas Od. 3. 3. 4), rainy
(umidus Virg. G. 1. 462, pluvias Ov. Met. 1. 66), and cold (friyiclus Virg.
G. 4. 261, hibernus Tib. l. 1. 47). 203. 1000, ‘position’ 204. extremi

. . priores: cf. 1. 2. 70, 71. usque, ‘ever' ; A. P. 154, 354 and often.
