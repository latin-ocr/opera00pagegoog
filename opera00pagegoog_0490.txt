on which the fish were exposed for sale. averrere, to sweep off, is used
because verro, averriculum are regularly applied to catching fish in the sea with
nets : see on 2. 3. 235. Horace means that it is no use paying a high price for
· fish if you cannot cook them properly. 38. ignarum quibus est : one would
expect the subj., but the poets are sometimes not particular in this regard,
when their metre is to be protected ; cf. Prop. 3. 4. 25-46, where he uses ind.
and subj. indiscriminately ; Virg. G. 4. 149 ; Ecl. 4. 52 ; Aen. 6. 615. ius τ
those which were boiled were served with sauce, apparently, not those which
were broiled (assi) 3 cf. the pun in Varro R. R. 3. 3. 9 in ius vocat pisces cocus.
38, 39. quibus assis . . . reponet: generally taken ‘and for which ones
broiled the tired guest shall again place himself on his elbow,' as if the mere
sight of certain fishes broiled would incite the guest to begin eating again, and
as though resting on the elbow were peculiarly the attitude while eating. It
seems better to take quibus assis as instrumental abl. after tanquidus (like
virio Zanyuidus Cic. Cat. 2. 5. 10), 01· 0186 as abl. absol. ‘which ones being
broiled, the guest, after eating his fill of them, shall at length replace himself
on his elbow,' reponet means that the guest, after eating till he was sated
(tanquidus), leaned back in his former position, resting on his elbow on the
pillow. The ordinary attitnde at dinner was to recline iri cubitum ε the eating
attitude was to lean forward towards the table over the large cubitat, or pillow.
See Smith's Dict. Ant. s.v. coena, ‘Each man, in order to feed himself, lay flat
on his breast, or nearly so, and stretched out his hand towards the table3
but afterwards, when his hunger was satisfied, he turned upon his left side,
leaning on his elbow ' ; also the illustration in Becker’s Charicles p. 327 3 and
cf. Plaut. Mil. 3. 1. 21 sed procellunt sese iri mensam dimidiati dum appetunt,
and so perhaps cubito presso od. 1. 27. 8, of the after-dinner attitude
reclining 011 the elbow.

41. curvat: bends the dishes‚ which were often of silver. inertem:
flat, insipid. 42. Laurens, ‘the Laurentian y‘uwk, the wild hog’s reedy
home ² (Macaulay), was about Laurentum, which was near the coast, between
Ardea and Ostia. 43. vinea: a he-goat was sacrificed to Bacchus, on

‘fruitful,' i.e. that has had young (Kiessling). Most MSS. have fecundi, and
elsewhere lepus is masc„ but vet. Bland. has fecundae. sapiens sectabitur,
‘the connoisseur will affect.' armos, ‘the wings‚' as the forelegs of hares
are generally called: see 1. 6. 106. 46. quaesita agrees with both aetas
and natura. 4'7. crustula, ‘pastry‚' a Lucilian word. 48. The only
place out of twenty-four in Horace where est is omitted with satis in the
phrase satis est. 50. olivo : the fish were ffied in oil. ’

blow,' 6. 804 at cum membra domans percepit fervida febris 1 tum fit octor vini
