GARMEN SAEOULARE

‘ O Phoebus and Dia-na, yrant our prayer at this solemn season when the
Sibylline verses ordain that a chorus of youths and maidens should chant a
hymn to the yods who love the seven hills (1-8). Ο life-yiviny San, ever do

· thou reyard Rome with thy favour, and thou, Ο yoddess that brinyest children
to the liyht‚ protect our mothers (9-16)‚ yea, and yive yood success to the new
marriaye laws and increase to our people, so that ayain and ayain throuyhout
the ayes they may in full numbers celebrate this holy festival (17-24). And do
you, O ye 1⁴'ates, determine for us a destiny in the future as ylorious as in the
past: may the earth yield her increase and the heavens drop fatness (25-32).
Hearlcen to us, Apollo, hearken, O Queen of Niyht, and, if Rome be indeed your
creation, and is under your yuardianship the race os Troy has been yuided to
yreater destinies, then yrant riyhteousness to our youths, peace to our elders,

prosperity, increase and ylory to our nation (33-48). C'hiefly fulfil his prayers .

sor him who is the ylorious descendant of Venus and Anchises, the conqueror
merciful as he is miyhty. His sway already the natione oum, already beneath
his care our ancient virtues and ancient blessinys are returniny (49-60). Y ea,
as surely as he reyards with favour the heiyhts os Palatinus, Phoebus yrants
another lustre, another aye os abidiny and ever-increasiny happiness: while
Diana from her temple lends her ear to the prayers os the Qaindecimviri and
our vows (61-72). That this is the will of the Immortals we carry home a
,qood and certain hope, after duly chantiny the praises of Phoebus and Diana. ’

For the occasion of this Ode see Od. 4. 6 Intr. As being written for public
pei-formance the Ode is more distinetly rhetorical than poetical, but the diction
has the merit of being simple and stately, while if, as in stanza 5, even Horace
halts, we may well pity the bard who has to invoke a poetic blessing on
pedantie legislation. Editors give various methods of dividing the Ode be-
tween the chorus of boys and that of girls. Perhaps the first two stanzas are
sung by the j0int chorus, the third by the boys, the fourth by the girls;
stanza 9 is sung half by boys and half by girls3 stanzas 10-15 seem to fall
into pairs, and so suggest that they were sung alternately by boys and girls 3
stanza 19 is clearly sung by all together.

Dict. Ant. Sibyllini Libri. They were in charge of the Quindecimviri (line

hexameter verse. 6. virgines . . . See Od. 4. 6 Intr. ’7. quibus
