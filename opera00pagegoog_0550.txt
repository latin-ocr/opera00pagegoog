Miletus, Pergamum, etc. Munro has the same reading, without comment. It
is not possible to translate ‘ were they greater or less than their reputation ’ζ’
for -ve is never used in disjunctive questions, where two alternatives are
contrasted. If this is to be the meaning, it is necessary to read oninoranefanza?
But it is better with Dillenburger to place a comma after minorave fama,
translating ‘ are all, whether greater or less than their reputation‚ of little
account in'your eyes compared with Ζ ’ 818. 4. campo : at once the finest

Bland. as a dialogue between Bullatius and Horace, thus: B. scis . . .
sit? H. Gabiis . . . vicu-9. B. tamen . . . furentem. We need not assign
Gabiis . . . vicus to Horace: but it is very probable that the whole
passage is to be regarded as spoken by Bullatius. There is a close parallel in
1. 16. 41-43, where the answer of a supposed interlocutor is similarly brought
in without any introductory word, and Horace demurs with a sentence
beginning with secl. 7. Gabiis : cs. Juv. 6. 56, 10. 100, where Gabii and
Fidenae 318 coupled as unimportant places. Of Gabii, Dionys. Hal. Ant. R.

without meaning to stay there.

17-21. The pleasure resorts of the East do not suit one who is in sounol
health. 17. incolumi facit (id) quod, ‘is to a healthy man what.’
Editors generally quote as parallel the use of facere with the dative=‘to

commonly with ad, Ov. Her. 6. 128 Medeae faciunt ad scelus omne manus.
