χρόνος Ι φύει τ’ ἄδηλα καὶ φανέντα κρύπτεται. , 111 apricum, ‘to the light
of day'zin apertum ,· if the word be, as is commonly supposed, contracted
from aperi-cu-s it is used here, but apparently here only, in its primary sense
(Roby 774). 26. porticus Agrippae: erected by Μ. Vipsanius
Agrippa in honour of Neptune, and adorned with paintings of the exploits of
the Argonauts; hence called porticus Vipsania, or Neptuni, or Aryonautarum
(Juv. 6. 153). It was thrown open to the public in 25 B. ο. (Dio Cass. 53. 27)
and would naturally be a fashionable lounge. via Appi: the reyina
viarum (Stat. Silv. 2. 2. 12) led to Capua and Brundisium (S. 1. 5. 6), and
would often be crowded by Roman nobles travelling to their villas in Campania,
or to Greece and the East. 27. Numa and. Ancus are Jbined, as being
the two most popular of the early kings ; cf. Ennius’ line adopted by Lucr. 3.

ἀρετή, λόγος ἄρ’ ἦσθ’· ἐγὼ δέ σε Ι ὡς ἔργον ἤσκουν · σὺ δ’ ἀρ’ ἐδούλευες τύχῃ.
32. lucum ligna, ‘a sacred grove but logS.' Notice virtutem verba and
lucum ligna: they sound the same, are they the same? portus
occupet, ‘ reaches the port before you,’ and so anticipates you in the mai-ket.
33. Cibyra was in the extreme S. of Phrygia on the borders of Lycia and
famous for its iron. Bithynia had some important ports, and large navi-
gable rivers, which brought down the produce of the interior, especially timber

is better off than a Iciny ; 30 is this is your ροαί, push on towards a stoutly.
