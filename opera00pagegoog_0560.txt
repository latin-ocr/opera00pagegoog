the glutton, and Horace's humorous expression of his intention to live on the

best fare that he can get. Maenius, a character attacked also by Lucilius;
cf. S. 1. 1. 101 11. 27. fortiter, ‘in a spirited fashi011'; ironieal‚ like
Pers. 6. 21 hic bona deute Ι yratzdia maquauimus peraqil puer. urbanus

(cf. 1. 9. 11) is best connected with scurra, as in Plaut. Most. 15 tu urbanus
vero scurra, deliciae popli, rus mihi lu obiectas? From Plaut. Trin. l. l. 165
urbani assidui cives, quos scurras vocant, we see that scurra had not quite the
same sense as in Horace, but meant rather ‘ lounger,' ‘ gossip.' In Catull. 22. 2
the urbanus equals the scurra of 5. 12, a ‘wit,' quite in a good sense, a
meaning which is found even 111 Cicero (pro Quinet. 3. 11 uam aeque parum
facetus scurra Sem. Naevius neque inhumanus praeco est umquam auctionatus),
although from de Orat. 2. 60. 247 11 appears that the bad sense was beginning
to be predominant. Horace, S. 1. 5. 52, shows the change complete; scurra
:parasitus ‘spungen’ 28. praesaepe, ‘crib ' t cf. Plaut. Cure. 2. 1. 13
tormento nou retiuerl poluit ,ferreo Ι quiu reciperet se huc esum ad praesepim
suam: so Eur. Eurysth. fr. 6 ἥν τις οἴκων πλουσίαν ἔχῃ φάτνην. 29. 111-
pransus, 16. if he had had 110 111031 that day: the prandium was the first sub-
stantial meal of the day, usually taken at mid-day. civem . . . hoste,
‘friend from foe.' 30. fingere saevus: for the inf. cf. Od. 1. 3. 25 n.
31. pernicies . . . macelli, ‘the ruin, and storm and abyss of the market,’
because 110 burst down upon it, carrying havoc with him, and swept off every-
thing into his insatiable maw. For barathrum cf. S. 2. 3. 166. macellum
originally 3 slaughter-house (cf. μάχαιρα, macto), thence a meat-market‚ and
so 3 111311101 for all kinds of provisions, 32. donabat z the main verb.

33. nequitiae, ‘his wicked wit? 35. vilis is evidently needed with
agninae more than with omasi (like ‘tripe' a Keltic word) which was
always a cheap coarse food 3 there are many instances in the Satires of el in
the second place in its clause: 39. 1. 3. 543 6. 11; 10. 71 010. Plautus
(Capt. 4. 2. 40) complains of the butchers who sold lamb dear: apparently he
expected it to be cheap. It is nowhere mentioned as 3 dainty. 36. lamna ε
contracted for lamina (better spelt lammina), as in Od. 2. 2. 2. Το11ι110
by the application of red-hot plates of metal is often mentioned, ay.
Plaut. As. 3. 2. 43 Lucr. 3. 1017 verbera, carufflceS, robur, pix, lammina,
taedae. scilicet ut diceret: the man’s coarse fare is humorously
represented as entitling him to censure severely epicures and spendthrifts.
nepotum, ‘prodigals'3 cf. Epod. 1. 34 and note; S. 1. 4. 49 'nepos filius.
The word is also common 111 Cicero in this sense, but not apparently else·
where. 37. Bestius. · unknown, but evidently an extravagant liver so
long as his means held out, and afterwards an unsparing critic of extrava-
gance. Most MSS. have correctus, some few correptus: the latter gives 110
good sense3 but the former may well be interpreted‘ like Bestius after 1113
reformationst Lambinus asserted that he had found‘ in antiquissimo codice'
corrector, which would give good sense, ‘a Bestius turned 0011301.’ Maenius
is of course the subject of diceret, and Bestius is in apposition.

39. verterat in fumum: a proverbial expression for ‘ consumed.’
miror . . . si: Roby 1757, S. G. 747; cf. θαυμάζω εἰ. 41. turdo:
S. 2. 2. 7 43 5. 10. vulva: the matrix of a sow was and still is considered
a great delicacy in Italy. It was prepared with spices and vinegar‚ and eaten
33 3 1011311 with wine (Athen. 3. 59). Prof. Palmer quotes very happily
Alexis (Meineke, Com. Graec. 738 ed. min.) ὑπὲρ πάτρας μὲν πᾶς τις ἀποθνή-
σκειν θέλει, Ι ὑπὲρ δὲ μήτρας Καλλὶμέδων ὁ Κάραβος Ι ἑφθῆς ἴσως προσεῖτ’ ἂν
