be rather ‘with sels-restrainn' as opposedhtaxthe common force of inpotens
and inpotenter? Mr. Reid suggests ‘he who *spanus all his powers on the
choice‚’ i.e. who uses every effort to choose aright. 41. facundia: cf.
Cato’s golden rule for an orator ‘rem tene, verba sequentur!

42-44. The mrtue of arranyement lies in a choiee of what has to be said at
the time. 42. ordinis, repeated by anaphora, as the subject matter of
this and the next two lines. The general rule περὶ τῆς εὐταξίας (Porph.) is
given in brief, for the detailed precepts depend entirely on the nature of the
matter dealt with. venus, ‘ charm,’ line 320. aut ego fallor, ‘ or
else Ι am quite mistaken ’ = ni fallor .· cf. Ov. Met. 1. 607 aut eyo fallor,
aut 690 laedor ; Livy praef. aut me amor suscepti negotii fallit, aut ete.
43. iam nunc, ‘at once‚’ ‘at this very time' ; ef. Ep. 2. 1. 127 ; Od. 2. 1.
173 3. 6. 23: the proper arrangement is secured by not saying anything
which is not immediately necessary to the clear comprehension of the narrative
or the sentiment. 44. pleraque, ‘ much ' as in Ep. 2. 1. 66 n.: so plerum-
que, ‘often‚' in Ep. 1. 18. 94, and above in line 14. differat expresses
rather the purpose of the poet, omittat his action: hence there is no tautology.

46-45. Bentley first transposed these two lines, so that hoc . . . hoe means
‘ one word . . . another word ’; many of the best recent editors have followed
him, and his reasoning seems to be irresistibly cogent. No error is more com-
mon in MSS. than the omission of a line, which afterwards is restored to a
wrong place: and hoc . . . hoe seems almost inexplicable, if referred to the
topic of order. It is extremely otiose to say that the composer of a poem long
promised is to make a selection of his subject matter. Schiitz attempts to
defend the traditional order, but with little success. His argument that dicat,
differat, and omittat need auctor as a subject is not strong3 the subject is
easily supplied from hunc of line 41: and the change to the second person
dixeris is not harsh‚ and does not require the introduction of a new theme.

45-59. Familiar words acquire freshness in a new connexion ; and new
words may be eoined with discretiori. 46. tenuis, here a word of praise‚
not blame=subtizis‚ λεπτός : cf. Od. 2. 16. 38. serendis, ‘ connecting‚'
suggesti-ng both the avoidanee of hiatus, and awkward Juxtaposition, and also
fresh syntactic combinations. 47. callida iunctura : Orelli quotes as
instances from Horace himself splendide mendax, insanientis sapientiae eon-
sultu3‚ animae magnae prodiyuS. Pr‘of. Nettleship happily refers to the charge
brought against Virgil by Agrippa that he had been suborned by Maecenas to
invent a new kind of affectation, which consisted in an unusual employment of
ordinary words, and was therefore difficult of detection (Sueton. 44) ; and
quotes phrases like recens caede, tela emit, tendit iter vetis (Conington’s Virgil 1.⁴
xxix-xxxiii). 49. indiciis: σημείοις. indicia verba appellavit: philosophi
enim dicant vindicandarum rerum caasa inventas 6336 voces—Porph. ab·
dita rerum, ‘ new coneeptions‚’ not previously brought to view. The great
majority of MSS. read rerum, et; if so we get et fingere continget . . . et ficta
habebant fidem. 50. cinctutis=qui cineta induebantur. The cinctus
was a broad waistband, or lom-eloth, worn by the old Romans instead of the
tunica under the toya, and by the younger men in their exercises in the
Campus, whence it was also called campestre. Porph. here says ε omnes enim
Oetheyi anam morem servaverunt Romae . . . numquam enim tunica usi sant:
ideo cinctutos eos dixit quoniam cinctus est genas tunicae infra pectus aptatae.
51. continget, ‘ you will be allowed ' : not very commonly used so without

, the dative expressed, as in Ep. 1. 17. 363 2. 2. 41. pudenter-:eam
