for help, when assailed by calumny. 81. qui . . . takes the argument a
step further—‘ and remember that when he (the man last mentioned) is attacked,
the danger is getting very near yourself.' Theon was some freedman notorious
for his biting slanders. 82. For dente cf. od. 4. 3. 16. circumroditur:
cf. S. 1. 4. 81. ecquid sentis, ‘ do you feel at all ’ζ’ i.e. ‘ don’t you feel 2 ¹
84. tua res agitur: cf. δην. 3. 198-200.

86-95. It is a hard tash to retain the favour of the power-ful, for you must
always fall iu with their humours. 88. hoc age, ‘give all your mind to
it ’ : S. 2. 3. 152 n.; Ter. And. 2. 1. 15 3 2. 5. 4. 91. Τ118 spuriousness of this
line does not admit of a question. It is not found in any of the good MSS„
and contains two inexplicable difficulties: (1) bibuli potores is little better
than potantes potores, while to connect bibuli with Falerni is to do violence to
the meaning of the word: (2) media de nocte could only mean ‘ as early as
midnight' ; cf. 1. 2. 32 3 14. 34. It is evident that some copyist (not before
the 11th century) feeling the need of a subject to oderunt introduced potores
and then attempted to make up the line by a clumsy adaptation of 1. 14. 34
quem bibulum liquidi media de luce Falerni. Vahlen, however, defends the
line as: ‘wine-bibbers ready to drink Falernian after midnight‚' πλε. ready,
after along debauch, to call for a fresh wine of the strongest sort. 93.
tepores has far more authority than vapore-5. tepor, however, generally
denotes a mild warmth‚ and the earliest instance quoted for it: ‘ feverishness’
is from Ammianus 19. 4. 2 tepore febrium arescunt. 94. nubem, a common
metapImr, which we may retain in translation ς ‘banish the cloud from your
brow.' Cf. Soph. Ant. 528 νεφέλη δ’ ὀφρύων ὕπερ αἱματόεν Ι ῥέθος αἰσχύνει,
Eur. Hipp. 172 στυγνὸν δ’ ὀφρύων νέφος αὐξάνεται, Shakespeare‚ Ant. and
Cleop. ΠΙ. 11. 52 ‘Will Caesar weep? He has a cloud in ’s face.' 95.
obscuriz‘ mysterious,' κρυψίνους. The modesty which prompts to reserve
often makes a man appear to be disguising his thoughts with a view to deceive.
Of. Cic. de Off. 3. 13. 57 hoc celandi yeuus . . . uon aperti, uon simplicis, ‘nou
iuyeuui, uon iusti, ‘nou viri boui (est), versuti potius, obscuri, astuti, fallacis.

96-103. W hat-ever you do, study philosophy, volucla alone cau yive you the
secret of a happy Zvjfe. 96. leges: Roby 1466, S. G. 602: ‘ you must
study for yourself . . . (to leam) how' etc. 98. num . . . agitet,
‘ whether greed ever unsatisfied is to torment yon.' aquei: represents the jussive
subj. of direct question [Roby 1612, S. G. 674 (b)], for obviously the question
which the man must study to understand is not whether he is tormented
but whether he is to be tormented. Or we may say that the direct question
would have been ayitatue me semper, with the present used for the future.
99. mediocriter utilium, ‘ things indifferent,' the ἀδιάφορα of the Stoics
which included all things generally considered hymen good and advantageous,

{vgthf'ghe exception of virtue, which is the summum bouum. Cf. Cic. de Fin. 3.

100. doctrina: the familiar inquiry of the philosophers: cf. Plat. Meno
ad init. ἂρα διδακτὸν ἡ ἀρετή ,· ἢ οὐ διδακτὸν ἀλλ’ ἀσκητόν ‚· ἢ οὔτε ἀσκητὸν
οὔτε μαθητόν, ἀλλὰ φύσει παραγίγνεται τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ; Cic. Part. Or. 64
quonam pacto virtus pumtur, naturane au ratione au usu ,· Od. 4. 4. 34.
Horace here does not mention the third alternative-domas, usus‘, ‘ practice.'
101. quid te tibi reddat amicum: another reminiscence of Plato 3 Rep. 10.
621 c δικαιοσύνην μετὰ φρονήσεως παντὶ τρόπῳ ἐπιτηδεύσομεν, ἵνα καὶ ἡμῖν
αὐτοῖς φίλοι ὦμεν καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς. 102. purezsiucere, ‘ what gives you
untroubled calm.’ ’ honos: public honours, especially office, which is often
