6. in primis: Kiessling (followed by Orelli4) rightly makes the boar served
cold and forming with the other piquant edibles the mastatio. That a boar,
which usually formed the eaput cenae, should be thus served marks extravagance.
cf. Pliny, H. N. 8. 51. 210 in principio (cenae) bini ternique manduntur apri.
Lucanus aper: cf. 2. 3. 234. leni Austro : the host at once begins to
speak of the peculiar excellences of his viands: a gentle south wind had, he said,
given the boar 3 delicate flavour ; boar's flesh was preferred rather high. fuit
‘ firstly there was a L. boar which had been caught . . . ’ ; captus is participle.
So Madvig, but most put colon after aper, ‘firstly a L. boar t it was one.

pater, like pater domus 2. 6. 88. 8. rapula and radices are both
species of radishes, the former perhaps the round white kind, resembling small
turnips in shape. 9. siser, ‘ skirret.' allec, ‘ fish-pickle. ’ faecula,
‘ tartar lees.'

10. acernam: next to the high-priced orbes of citrus wood‚ maple tables
were most prized at Rome3 Plin. H. N. 16. 15. 66 acer operum eleyantia
ae subtilitate citro seeundum; Mart. 14. 90 ; Mayor on Juv. 1. 137. 11.
gausape, a towel with a thick nap3 nom. sing. qausapes or ⁷qausape ‚-
also qausapum: in plur. ⁴‹mu-sapa. The line is from Lucil. 517 puvpureo
tersit tum latas ,qausape mensas. purpureo: both the' table and the
towel are quite grand. pertersit: the table had no eloth on it ; but that
was not strange3 the use of table-cloths was later: Becker's Gallus 2. 153.
12. sublegit: such slaves were called analectae. Mart. 7. 20. 17 colliqere
lonya turpe neo putat dextra Ι analecta quidquid et canes reliquerunt. 13.
Attica virgo: one of the κανηφόροιτ cf. 1. 3. 9 n. The point is the
solemn air with which Hydaspes advances with the wine in his hands, as
though such wine were not to be met with at every house. 14. fuscus
Hydaspes: a black slave from India who was called after the river of his
native land. So Enipeus od. 3. 7. 23 ; Hebrus 3. 12. 6. Fritzsche mentions
a philosopher Euphrates, Plin. Ep. 1. 10. 1. 15. Caecuba: a very choice
wine; see Dict. Ant. s. v. vinum. vina: poetic sor vinum ; cf. Epod. 2.
47 et horna dulci υίπα promens dolio. So Caecubum Od. 1. 37. 5, but Caecuba

expers, z'. e. the very best that could be got. To the choice wines of Chios
and Lesbos no brine was added: see Galen x. p. 833 οὐ μὴν οὐδὲ εἰώθασι τοῖς
εὐγένεσιν οἴνοις . . .μίγνυναι τῆς θαλάσσης ἐν Λέσβῳ, ὥσπερ οὐδὲ ἐν Χίῳ.
The poorer sorts were thus doctored, τεθαλασσωμένοι. So in Italy resinata
vina were inferior (Mart. 3. 77. 8); cf. Columella 12. 19. 2 quaecumque vini
nota sine condimento valet perennare optimam esse censemus. So we talk of

‘'brut wine-⁶3.

16. Albanum and Falernum were not ranked as high as Caecuban by
Pliny : Alban was placed in the third, Falernian in the second class, though
in his day equal to any. 17. habemus utrumque: the words mark
the ostentation of Nasidienus: he produces the choicest Caecuban, but not
content with that, remarks that if his guest prefers these other fine wines they
are both at hand. It is this ostentation which wrings from Horace the ex-
clamation divitias miseras! ‘what wretched riches ! ' i. e. what a wretched
