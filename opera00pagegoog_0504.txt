476 ’ HORACE Book 11

Arelli, a rich man ; probably a miserly old fellow. 79. sollicitas in

sense belongs closely to iynarus, though not in syntax ; ‘ignorant of the cares
they bring’ (cf. Od. 3. 6. 17).

79. olim, ‘once on a time! 82. attentus quaesitis, ‘ with a close
eye to his hoard.’ attentas is often used absol. for ‘close,' ‘frugaL’ Ep. 1.
7. 91; 2. 1. 172. ut tamen qualifies attentus: ita ut or sic ut are
generally used in this sense. 83. solveret hospitiis, ‘ expand,’ ‘ open his
heart in hospitality ’ ε solveret is in opposition to artum. ille: emphatic ;
‘ he was not the mouse to grudge.' 84. sepositi ciceris: his precious
vetches had a place to themselves. The genitive with invidere is a Greek
construction, φθονεῖν τινί τινος.“ longae ε probably of the long shape of the
grain ε not the tall stalk, nor the long glume at the end of the grain, as Comm.
Cruq. explains it. 87. tangentis male singula, ‘ scarcely trying one by
one,’ and rejecting as soon as tried. 88. pater domus ε the Amphitryon ε
like cenae pater 2. 8. 7.

91. patientem, καρτεροῦντα, ‘roughing it.' 92. vie tu, ‘can't you ’.ἰ ’
‘won’t you 2 ’ a strong exhortation: viri ta simply a question, ‘will you ’ἐ ’ as

Epicurean theory of the mortality of the soul: festive ‘mus urbanus Epi-
cureum philosophum aqit (Orelli). sortita, λελογχότα, ‘having been
allotted by fate? 95. quo, bone, circa: the only instance extant of
tmesis in quocirca. Lucilius was famous, as Ennius was too, for more re-
markable tmeses than this, and it is not unlikely that this very tmesis is
taken from Lucilius : cf. Ausonius, Epist. 5. 36 villa Lucani—mox potieris—
aca (for Lucaniaca), adding Dacili vates sic imitator eris, and every one knows

{ige simolgerZ—geomminuit—brum of Ennius. 96. dum licet: Od. 2. 11.
, . . .

98. pepulere, smote, influenced: Cic. de Off. 3. 10. 41. 100. iamque

the peculiar sheen of purple3 Od. 4. 1. 20 n. 105. procui, ‘close by.'

succinctus: like a slave girt up sor waiting at dinner: cf. praecincti 2. 8.
70; Juv. 8. 162 et cum venali Cyane succincta lagena. The epithet well
describes the empressement of the host. cursitat, runs hither and thither
supplying the wants of his guest. 108. continuatque dapes, ‘serves
course after course.' nec non verniliter: the town mouse could not
resist the temptation of taking a lick at the things he offered his guest, therein
resembling slaves who furtively dipped their fingers into the dish and licked
them (dum furta ligurrit 2. 4. 79).

111. agit laetum convivam, ‘ plays the well-pleased guest.' Cf. Ov.
