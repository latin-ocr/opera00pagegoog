with false friends. 433. derisor: 01. Ep. 1. 18. 11. plus, more usual
than maqis with verbs of emotion. 434. reges, ‘ princes,' i.e. wealthy men,
as in S. 2. 2. 45 epulis 70977777, or it may have its regular force here. culullis
(or culillis): the derivation is uncertain, but the word is probably akin to
mdiyna=xv>dxvn (Fest. p. 51). 435. torquere : 01. Ep. 1. 18. 38. per-
spexisse: cf. line 98. laborent is on the whole better supported than
laborant 3 Bentley says sane quid modus subiwwtiws hic faciat, 77077 m'deo, and
most recent editors (even Keller) follow him. But surely the relative clause
is suboblique. If the construction had been dicunt reyes etc., the subjunctive

will not deceive you ’ i.e. if you take my advicez‘take care that they do
not deceive you.’ sub vulpe: the reference is to Aesop’s Fable (Phaedr.
1. 3) in which the fox praises the crowfs voice, in order to make her drop the
cheese which he covets. So the flatterers of the rich poet are ‘ foxes,' and he
will do well to study their ‘ concealed purpose.’

harsh, for the toruus was used for metals, e.9. braSS, and the meaning is ‘ if
the finishing tool has been thrice applied without 81100088, the misshapen thing
must be placed upon the anvil and hammered up, so that a new start may be
made. ’ Both metaphors are very commonly used 01 poetry. Cf. Ovid, Trist.
