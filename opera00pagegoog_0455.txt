pinus: so Horace nicknames M. Furius Bibaculus of Cremona. He had
written a poem on Caesar’s Gallic wars, 111 which occurred the bombastic line
Iuppiter hibernas cana nive conspuit Alpes (see 2. 5. 41) ι hence his nickname
Alpinus here. He had also composed an Aethiopis, perhaps translated from
Arctinus, in which he introduced the slaying of Memnon by Achilles,
iugulat, ‘ cuts the throat of,’ ‘murders,' refers both to Achilles and to the
bad poetry of Bibaculus.

37. defingit, ‘botcheS‚' ‘disfigures’ ; for this bad sense of cle cf. defor-
mare, describo Ep. 2. 1. 154 n. luteum: the epithet ‘muddy ’ may have
been introduced by Bibaculus himself, and been laughed at as out of place in
an epic. caput, either the source, as often, or the mouth, as Caes. B. G
4. 10 ; Livy 33. 41 ; or, more probably, the head of the Rhine‚ described as
personified in the poem of Bibaculus (as rivers were personified· in triumphal
processions : PerS. 6. 47 ; Prop. 2. 1. 31 3 Ov. A. A. 1. 223). 38. aede:
in aecle Musarum ubi poetae carmina sua recitabant: Porph. This is very
vague. Horace probably means a temple, where dramatists‚ who were scel<-
ing the privilege of having their plays acted, rehearsed them before Tarpa.
iudice Tarpa: Sp. Maecius Tarpa was a public licenser of plays. He had
been appointed to discharge this duty by Pompey in 55 B.C. Cic. ad Fam. 7.
1. 1 nobis autem erant ea perpetienda quae Sp. Maecius probavisset.

40. arguta, ‘tricky,' ‘sly': cf. calo aryutus Ep. 1. 14. 42. Davus is
the accepted type of a elever slave (e. 9. 111 the Andria of Terence) and Chremes
(cf. A. P. 94 n.) of an old man. Fundanius is only known from this passage
and 2. 8. 19. 41. comis, nominative, not, as many: comes: comis is
always of persons, or of personal qualities. garrire, of the sermo quoti-
dianus of comedy: ‘write chatty plays‚' cf. below canit of tragedy‚ ducit of
epic poetry. 42. Pollio, one of the most remarkable figures of the age——
soldier, orator, tragedian‚ historiari· , see Od. 2. 1. 9 seq. 43. pede ter
percusso, i.e. in Iambic trimeter verse, in which the ictus occurs thrice. pede
is here ⁶ metre,' and does not refer to the beat of a musician's foot accompany-
ing the metre, as it is taken by Orelli: translate, ‘in metre thrice accented.’
44. ut nemo, ὡς οὐδεὶς ἄλλος. Varius: see on 1. 5. 40. Varius was con-
sidered as the epic poet of Rome until Virgil eclipsed him. ducit, ‘draws
out’ ;the metaphor 15 from spinning, and deducere 15 mbr-e common, cf. Ep. 2.
1. 225 n. molle atque facetum, ‘tenderness and grace? Quintil. 6.
3. 19, struck by this attribution of facetum to Virgil, says: facetum quoque
non tantum circa ridicula opinor consistere. neque enim diceret Horatius
facetum carminis ,oenus natura concessum esse Viryilio. decoris hanc magis
et excultae cuiusdam eleyantiae appellationem puto. The reference is to the
Eclogues which were published Β. 0. 37, and Sellar (p. 165) explains the two
adjectives as denoting‘ (1) the yielding susceptibility to outward influences
and (2) the vivacity which gives them back in graceful forms? Palmer takes
facetum of‘ humour' or ‘gaiety‚' and refers to Virgil' s early writinga 59. the

46. erat : satire was the only branch of literature left for one to take up.
P. Terentius Varro, surnamed Atacinus, from Atax, a vicus or town, as well
as a river of Gallia Narbonensis, was about seventeen years senior to Horace,
82-37 Β.0., not to be confounded with his namesake, the famous polymath M.
