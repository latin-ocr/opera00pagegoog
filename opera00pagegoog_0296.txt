268 HORAOE “ Boon 11

10. summovet. This word is technically used of the lictors making a
disorderly crowd ‘ move on ’ ; cf. Livy 3. 48 i lictor, summove turbam and
see Dict. tumultus, ‘ disturbances‚’ a continuation of the metaphor of
summovet. 11. curas volanteS‚ ‘cares that flit (even) round fretted
roofs' ; ‘cares ’ are readily thought of as winged (cf. line 23, and Theogn. 729
φροντίδες ἀνθρώπων ἔλαχον πτερὰ ποικίλ’ ἔχουσαι), and are then spoken of as
bats or ill-omened birds that haunt even the dwellings of the wealthy.
laqueata tecta (cf. 2. 18. 2) are roofs much carved and panelled (laqueatus
from lacus ‘ a hollow ')‚ such as are only found in the dwellings of the great,
the ‘ eeiled houses ’ of Haggai i. 4.

13. vivitur parvo bene, cui: lit. ‘it is lived on little well to him to

whom (ei, eui),' πλε. ‘he lives well on little, for whom . . . ' For rm'vere’
parvo ef. S. 2. 2. 1. parvo and bene form a sort of oxymoron ε ‘ to live well ' is
not ‘to live sumptuously.' paternum . . . salinum: the ‘silver salt-

cellar ' is his one piece of family plate. 80113 being a necessary accompaniment
of food, salt and the salt-cellar have always been regarded with special respect.
14. splendet, ‘is spotless‚' tle. kept carefully cleaned and polished. tenui,
‘humble.’ cf. Pers. Sat. 3. 25 rure paterno Ι est tibifar modicum, parvum et
sine labe salinam Ι . . . hoe sat-ts? 15. leves, ‘like infants’ slumbers pure
and liqna! cupido sordidus, ‘ignoble greed.’ cupido is always masc.
in Horace. timor and cupido are opposed as ‘sear of loss ' and ‘ greed of gain.'

17. brevi fortes, antithetical; the shortness of life does not check
daring attempts. The same antithesis occurs 1. 3. 37 nil mortalibus ardui est.
iaculamur multa, ‘do we aim at many things,' i.e. form many ambitious
projects. For nobler lines on the same theme cf. Milton's Lycidas 67-84‚
‘Were it not‚’ etc. 18. quid terras . . . mutamus, ‘why do we ex-
change (i.e. take in exchange for our own) countries . . . ’ζ’ etc. alio sote is
used with a slight inaccuracy: ‘ another climate! 20. fugit, perfect3
‘has (by becoming an exile) escaped himself? Of. Ep. 1. 11. 27 eaelum non
animam mutant qui trans mare currunt,· Milton P. L. 1. 254 ‘ The mind
is its own place and of itself Ι Can make a Heaven of Heu, a Hel] of Heaven.’

21. vitiosa cura, ‘ morbid ’—e mentis vitio orta, Orelli. aeratas
naves, ‘ships with their brazen prows ’3 the adj. is added to show that
care is no respecter of persons3 no position however dignified, not even the
pomp and pageantry of a great expedition, can terrify it. The thought is
borrowed from Lucr. 2. 40 si ‘non forte tuas leyiones per toea campi Ι fervere
cum videas . . . fervere cum videas classem lateque vayari, Ι his tibi tum rebus
timefactae reliqio‘nes Ι effuyiunt animo pavide, mortisque timores Ι tum vacuum
peetus lincunt curaque solutum. On the other hand, 3. 1. 39, aerata tri-
remis is a private yacht. 26. oderit curare, ‘let it (animus) scorn to
be careful about . . .’ laetus in praesens animas is the nom. to oderit, and
quod ultra est the acc. after curare. It is necessary to render curare ‘be
careful ' because of eura above, but the phrase must be used with the same
meaning as in Luke x. 41 ‘ Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about
many things.’ lento, ‘ quiet.' lentas (from root len=soft) which when
applied to things means ‘clinging‚' ‘ sticky,' ‘tough‚' ‘pliant‚' etc„ when used
of persons or qualities means ‘dull,' ‘phlegmati0‚’ ‘easy-going‚' ‘quiet ’3 it
is opposed to such words as ‘nervous‚’ ‘excitem' ‘ energetic‚' cf. Virg. Ecl. 1.
4 tu, Tityre, lentus in ambra ; Cic. de Or. 2. 190 lente ferre, ‘to take easily.'

29. abstulit . . . These lines give examples of the general truth nihil
. . . beatum. Achilles had the choice of a brief but glorious career, or of one
