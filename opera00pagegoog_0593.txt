and see Munro’s Criticisms of Catullus 76-78. 147. accepta, ‘ handed down,’
from one year to another, as the time of harvest came round. Orelli gives
‘ welcome.’ 148. amabiliter, ‘ in friendly fashion.’ iam saevus, ‘now
growing savage.' 149. coepit verti z it is not necessary to defend this con-
struction, by pointing to the middle force of verti. Although in classical
prose coeptus sum is as a rule used with a passive infinitive, Tacitus regularly
uses coepi: we find in Lucret. 2. 613 coepisse creari ,· Ov. Met. 3. 106 coepere
nwveri, and cf. 1. 15. 27 ; A. P. 21. Livy uses coepi with passives. 150.
inpune minax, ‘assailing with impunity,’ because no law as yet checked
excess. cruento, ‘that drew blood.’

152. super : this use of super for de is not found in good prose between
Cato super tali re, and Livy, except in Cicero's letters (8.9. ad Att. 10. 8. 10
sed hac super re nimis), where he often adopts the more conversational style
of the comedianS. From Plautus five instances are quoted. lex: the first
law enacted as to mala camina was that passed by the ‹lecemvirs in the XII
Tables : cf. Cic. de Rep. 4. 10. 12 nostrae XII tabulae cum pemaucas ‘res
capite sanxissent, in his hanc quoque sanciendam putaremini, si quis occenta-
visset sive cumen condidisset, quod infamiam faceret flayitiumve alteri. There
was in the time of Horace a further lex Cornelia, passed by Sulla in 81 B.c.,
de iniuriis, which included libellous publicationS. As the punishment was
capite, it seems that fustis refers to the old punishment of the fustuarium or
cudgelling to death. 153. lata : the phrase ferre leqem strictly means only
to ‘ bring forward ’ a law, not to ‘ carry ¹ it, which is perferre ; but where there
is no necessity sharply to distinguish between the proposal of a law and the
passing of it, serre is occasionally used, as here, :pefferra 154. describi :
cf. S. 1. 4. 3 si quis emt digmus describi, quod malus acfiw, Ι quod moechus foret.
So often in Cicero sor depicting the bad features in a character. vertere
modum, ‘ changed their tone.’ The supervision of the authorities over public
literary efforts seems to have been severe and continuous (cf. Mommsen, Hist.
1. 474), and the result not simply what Horace here describes (ib. 2. 432
‘ the restrictions thus stringently and laboriously imposed by custom and
police on Roman poetry stifled its very breath ²). 155. bene, opposed to
nuile, of the moral tone, not the artistic quality of the writing.

156. Graecia capta: Greece cannot be said to have been subdued before
the capture of Corinth in 146 13.0.; but Greek literature was familiar to the
educated at Rome, and the Greek dramas brought upon the stage in the form

‚ of translations and adaptations more than half a century earlier by Naevius,

EnniuS, and Plautus. Horace, however, is looking rather at the general fact
that Greece though conquered in arms proved victorious in letters than at the
precise chronological sequence. 158. defluxit, ‘ dropped away,' ‘passed
out of use.’ numerus Saturnius: its general character is well de-
scribed by Macaulay in the Introduction to his Lays of Ancient Rome.
The metre appears to have been used very rarely after the time of Naevius.
There are, however, some rude instances in sepulchral inscriptions, (3.9.
C. I. R. 1. 34. The typical instance is dabant malum Metelli Ι Ναέυίὸ poetae .·
but the numerous irregularities, which are admissible, fully justify Horace’s
epithet of horridus. Cf. Wordsworth’s Specimens 396. grave virus,
‘the noisome venom’: virus is any offensive fluid; for its metaphorical
use cf. cic. Lae-1. 23. 87 apud quem evmnet virus acerbitatis suae. 159.
