SATIRE vt NOTES 411

consul), and that Appius the censor would have turned me out of the senate,
for my ignoble birth’ (which 116 would not have done, for he admitted the
sons of freedmen to the senate). So far all is sensible and consistent. But
the natural conclusion that we expect does not follow. We should expect
‘granting such to be the judgment of the multitude, surely our judgment is
different, and we men of culture at any rate should see no reason why a man
of low birth should be excluded from the senates Instead of this, quite παρὰ
προσδοκίαν, the words vel merito are introduced, wrenching the satire into
a different theme. Up to line 22 the subJ'ect is the vanity of long descent;
from line 22 the subject is the folly of a ‘novas homo secking public office.
esto: a concessive particle, frequently used by Horace (cf. 2. 2. 30)
when passing from a point which he is willing to concede for argument's
sake, to a point which cannot be conceded. Orelli4 punctuates ‘namque esto .·
populus· . . . ‚ explaining ‘for grant (that I sought office) ε the people would
prefer a Laevinus to a novus homo even if he were a Decius, and the censor
would ‹legrade him, quite rightly too, for I ought to have kept in my place.’
So too Kiessling.

20. Decio. Decius MuS‚ consul 340 B.c., in which year 116 devoted himself
at the battle of Mt. Vesuvius in the Latin war, was the first consul of his
family ; hence 116 was a navus homa movere was the regular phrase for
degradation from the senate by the censors: cf. also tribu„ movere. 21.
Appius. The explanation given above demands that this should refer to
Appius Claudius Caecus, censor 312 Rc. It is generally taken to refer to the
severe censorship of Appius Claudius Pulcher, 50 B.c., of which Caelius writes
to Cicero (ad Fam. 8 14. 4) scis Appium censorem hic ostenta facere . . . acerrime
aye‘reZ persuasum est ei censuram lomentum aut nitrum esse: errare mihi
videtur ,· nam sordes eluere vult, venas sibi omnes et viscera apem't. But as
the example of Decius is taken from antiquity, the example of Appius ought
to be ancient likewise3 and as the supposition in the case of Decius and
Laevinus is 611 impossible one, the supposition in the case of Appius should
be an impossible 0116 also, and it would not be an impossible one if it referred
to Appius of 50 Β. 6. For he would have rejected the low-born3 Appius
Caecus would not, and did not. Livy tells us 9. 46 that he in his censorship
senatum primus libertinorum filiis lectis inquinaverat. Horace has this
historica] fact 111 his mind’s eye, and he gives his obtrectatores a gentle re-
minder‚ that if he did aim at senatorial rank he would not be the first freed·
man's son who had attained it. 22. vel merito: vel, like γε, intensifies
the word it is J'oined to: ‘ ay, and Ι should have deserved degradation.’
in propria pelle: a proverbial expression, derived from the fable of the Ass
in the Lion’s Skin3 cf. 2. 1. 64 detrahere ec pellem. Horace often refers to
the fables of Aesop: as the Fox and the Crow, 2. 5. 563 the Frog and the
Ox, 2. 3. 314 3 the Two Wallets, 2. 3. 299 ; the Fox and the Old Lion, Ep. 1.
1. 73. 23. sed fulgente. This truth, however, does not commend itself
to the crowd of nobodies, whom we see struggling after office and honour.
Cf. Ep. 2. 1. 177 quem tulit ad scaenam ventosa Gloria curru.

24. quo tibi . . . Cf. Ov. A. A. 1, 303 quo tibi, Pasiphae, pretiosas sumere
vestes? Am. 3. 8. 47 quo tibi turritis incingere moenibus urbes? Tim:
Tillius hic senata motas est a Caesare quasi Pompeianus ,· occiso vero Caesare
‘recepit latum iterum clavum, id eet, senatoriam dignitatem, et tribunus militam
factus est .· Oomm. Cruq. He is supposed to have been brother of Tillius
Cimber, one of Caesar's murderers. 25. clavum: the broad purple
