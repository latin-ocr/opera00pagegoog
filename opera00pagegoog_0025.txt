NOTES ΟΝ METRES xix

ἓ 5. The fourth line cannot begin with two dactyls without caesura :
nobilis Ι omnia Ι dixit Ι ille is not a line. In the second dactyl a weak
caesura is distinctly avoided as giving too rapid a movement to the line.

The exceptions are 1. 9. 8 o staliarche lmerum diota ; 31. 16 me
cichorea Ι levesque malvae; 2. 3. 8 interiore notaFaZerni ; 4. 9. 8Ste3ick0rique

Ι qraves Camenae. In 1. 16. 12 Iuppiter ipse ruens tumultu the line
is intentionally rapid ; in 1. 26. 12 teque tuasque decet sorores the
emphasis 011 the repeated te tuas outbalances the weak caesura3 for 2.
1. 36 quae caret ora cruore metro see notes.

If, however, there is a full stop after the first dactyl the reason for
this rule vanishes and it need not be observed : 1. 35. 36 liquimus? unde
manum iuventus ; 2. 13. 8 hospitis ; ille venena Colcha ; 2. 17. 8 inteqer?
ille dies utramque.

It will be noted that the rule is absolute in the Third Book.

The first six Odes of Book ΙΙΙ. afford the best model of Alcaics. The
Odes in Book IV. exbibit only three variations from strict metrical rules 3
this is in exact accordance with their frigid and formal character3 the
long fourth Ode has absolutely no metrica] flaw,

The Sapphic Stanza is so called from Sappho the Greek poetess of
Lesbos. It is used in the following Odes‚ which contain in all 204

stanzas—I. 2, 10, 12, 20, 22, 25, 30, 32, 38; II. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 16; III.
8, 11, 14, 18, 20, 22, 273 IV. 2, 6, 11 and Carmen Saeculare.

51. Synaphaea prevails: in no case is a line ending with a short vowel
followed by a vowel at the beginning of the next line in the same stanza.

The exceptions are 1. 2. 41 fiyura Ι ales ; 12. 6 Haemo {undu 12. 7
insecutae Ι Orphea; 12. 25 Ledae Ι hunc ; 12. 31 ponto Ι unda; 22. 15

The close connexion between the lines 13 shown by the way in which
et can end a line, 2. 6. 1 mecm et Ι Cantabrum ; 6. 2 nostra et Ι barbarae.
3. 8. 27 horae et Ι linque ; 27. 22 Austri et Ι aequoris ; 27. 29 florum et Ι
debitae. So too 3. 8. 3 carbo in Ι caespite. 4. 6. 11 collum in Ι pulvere.

In several instances the lines are actually connected : 2. 2. 18 dissidens
plebi numero beatorlum eximit ; 16. 34 tibi tollit hinnitlum apta. 4. 2.
22 moreslque aureos ; 2. 23 πίρνοΙᾳαε invidet ; O. S. 48 prolemlque et decue.
The third line especially is so c osely connected with the fourth that in
three instances a word is divided between them: 1. 2. 18 labitur ripa
Iove non probante ulam-ius amnis. 1. 25. 11 Thracio bacchante mayis sub
interilunia venta 2. 16. 7 Grosphe‚ non qemmis neque pamm ‘velnalc
neque auro,

ἓ 2. In the first three lines abreak usually occurs after the fifth syllable,
but occasionally for the sake of variety—especially in ‘long Odes—Horaee
admits such lines as Mercuri facundie nepos Atlantis, Six instances
occur in the First Book, one in the Second, none in the Third, twenty-
two 111 the Fourth, and nineteen in the 76 lines of the Carmen Saeculare.
