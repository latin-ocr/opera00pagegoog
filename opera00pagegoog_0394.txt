1. caelum contraxit, ‘has made the sky lower,’ i.e. made the 1000 01
heaven look threatening 3 cf. contrahere frontem, supercitia, etc. At the same

not be excluded. 2. deducunt Iovem. Graphio: the ‘rain and snow '
come down in 811011 11108808 that they seem to bring down the sky itself with
them, cf. Od. 1. 16. 11 11. Horace is copying Anacreon, Fr. 6 Δία, τ’ ἄγριοι

Threioib Aquilone. The hiatus is helped by the caesura and the proper
names: Virgil is fond of it in the 5th foot, e.9. Actaeo AracynthO, Neptuno
Aeyaeo. Bentley's amice for amici, though many accept it, is needless.
Horace here addresses all his friends who. are present: in 11110 6 he addresses
one of them specially, because at a feast some one person was made ‘lord of
the revel ' (arbiter bibendi, Od. 2. 7. 25). 4. de die. To be taken closely

what it offers 3 cf. Od. 1. 11. 8 3 3. 8. 27. Porphyrion has ‘convivia de die'
dicebantur a primo mane 0094910,- cf. Od. 1. 1. 20 3 Ep. 1. 14. 343 Catull. 47.

luxury, intemperance, and the like: 10111 here, where there is no such reference,
the simpler meaning of the words is far preferable. virent genua: cf.
Theocr. 14. 70 ποιῆν τι δεῖ, ἃς ’γόνυ χλωρόν-τνν11110 young and strong. For
virens of youth, cf. Od. 1. 9. 173 4. 13. 6, and the ‘ knees ' are regularly used as
a symbol 01 strength3 cf. the Homeric γούνατ’ ἔλυσεν and Ps. cix. 24 ‘my
knees are weak ' 3 Is. xxxv. 3 ‘ confirm the feeble knees.’

5. obducta solvatur. Antithetical juxtaposition—‘ unknit the frowning
