Horace was well acquainted with and disposed to favour the philosophy of
Epicurus, one of the cardinal points of which was that either gods did not
exist at all or that they lived a life remote from care (securum afferre aevum S.
1. 5. 101) taking no concern for the earth or its inhabitants (cf. Tennyson’s
Lotus-Eaters ‘ On the hills like gods together, careless of mankind ²). Many
things, wh 1611 1116 vulgar believed to declare the presence of God, were but
the results of the ordinary 6611011 of natural forces. Among many other
arguments one of the most popular was ι if thunder be the voice of God, why
does it never thunder except when there are clouds about and it can therefore
be explain ed on natural grounds 2 (Cf. Lucr. 6. 400 denique eurr numquam
caelo iacit undique puro Ι Iuppiter in terras fulmen sonitusque profundit 2)
