SATIRE VI
Isife in the Toum and Life in the Ooantry. 31 or 30 B. 0.

The following Satire takes rank as one of the finest of the compositions of
Horace. Its object is the exaltation of a quiet life in the country, compared
with the ceremony and the annoyances of town ε 611 air of calm pervades the
whole. Made happy by his Sabine farm, the poet asks no 111016, 1-15. What
theme then 30 fit to celebrate as his mountain farm? 16, 17. Most poets
begin their works with an invocation to some god ; 30 Horace calls on J anus,
father of the morning, the patron saint of the beginnings of all human works,
20-23. This invocation reminds the poet what a different sort of day 13
ushered in by Janus at Rome and in the country. At Rome he has to go
first thing to the law-courts, to give bail for 6 friend, 24 ; 111611, although a
visit to Maecenas is like honey to him, the rude jostling and sneers he meets
with on his way thither are hard to endure, 29-33 ; while at Maecenas' levee
importunate people thrust their affairs upon him, 35-37, and others beg his
intercession with Maecenas, making too much of his supposed friendship with
the minister, 38-60. How he longs for the country amidst it all 1 his books,
idleness, vegetableS, and simple fare ! his suppers half divine, with his country
neighbours as his guests 3 his merry and contented slaves, 60-70 ; the rational
conversation on subJects of high concern, not gossip about this man's house,
or a famous dancer’s steps, 70-763 and then good old neighbour Cervius
will tell us his old fables to enforce contentment, and 166611 113 country mice
not to envy ’ 1116 luxurious dangers of 1116 city. The date of the Satire is
pretty accurately fixed in the end of 31, or the beginning of 30 B.0. by lines
40, 53, 55 : see the notes on these lineS.
