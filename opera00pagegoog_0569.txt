ritca, no invidia. Horace may be thinking of some different story, in which a
crow by the noise which it makes over some booty which it has discovered
attracts others to claim a share in it.

52. Brundisium might be visited for business or on state-affairs, as by
Maecenas ; cf. S. 1. 5. Surrentum for pleasure: it was especially famous
for its mild and salubrious climate, Sil. Ital. 5. 466 Zephyro Suwentum molle
salubri. 53. salebras=asperitales itineris Acron3 cf. Mart. 9. 58. 5 quae
Flaminiam secant salebrae. The roads to Brundisium and Surrentum were
among the best in Italy. 55. refert, ‘repeats,' i.e. imitates: cf. 1. 13. 62 ;
Tac. Anu. 1. 26 easdem artes Drusum rettulisse. catellam: probably
here a diminutive of catena, not of catulus. The chain is a more natural
accompaniment of the periscelis than the favourite dog.

58. triviis, chosen by the impostor as the scene of his accident, because
at ‘cross-roads' there would be most passere-by. 59. planum: cf. Matt. xxvii.

60. dicat: an asyndeton, ‘though he says.' Osirim: the worship of
Egyptian deities was at this time much 011 1110 increase at Rome, so that
Augustus (Dio Cass. 53. 2) did not allow their rites within the city. The
people looked upon them with great awe (Val. Max. 1. 3. 3) ; and hence the
oath of the impostor. 62. peregrinum, i.e. one who does not know your
tricks. rauca: Porph. sayszad ravim, i.e. ‘ till they are hoarse.' But why
should the neighbours bawl so long at the impostor, as to ruin their voices?
The word merely denotes the harsh dissonant eries of the mocking crowd.

EPISTLE XVIII

This Epistle is in some MSS. and by the scholi-asts taken as a continuation
of the preceding one, and the latter even speak of ‘ Lollius Scaeva! The only
jilstification for this is that at first sight the main theme, the manner in which
an inferior should associate with a superior in rank and wealth, appears to be
the same in both. But a little consideration shows that the position of
Lollius is very different from that of Scaeva. The latter is evidently of
narrow means, and probably of humble origin: his object in courting a patron
is to obtain a decent livelihood: the former is in possession of an ancestral
estate (line 60) with a lake on it large enough to be made the scene of a sham
sea-fight, represented by two fleets of boats manned by numerous slaves. The
date is fixed by lines 55-57 to about 20 B.o. : it is therefore exceedingly im-
probable that the Epistle was addressed to the Lollius who was consul in 21
B.c. (for whom see od. 4. 9 Intr.) ε but it may probably have been addressed
to his son (see 1. 2 Intr.) The tone of the Epistle has been severely censured
by some editors 3 but the key to it seems to be found 111 1110 epithet liberrime
of line 1, which, taken in connexion with line 5 seq„ plainly denotes an out-
spoken frankness, in danger of passing into offensive rudeness, Horace blames -
in the most explicit language all unworthy servility, and points out the
dangers and vexations of a court-life very frankly. But seeing that his young
friend is embarked upon it, he gives him the advice which his temperament
seemed most to require, namely that a man who seeks the patronage of one
superior to himself in social station should not offend him by persistently
obtruding his own opinions on matters of trifling importance, by displaying
his own vices and follieS, by prying into secrete, and betraying them, by find-
ing fault with his friend's tastes and pursuits, by incontinent loquacity‚ and
