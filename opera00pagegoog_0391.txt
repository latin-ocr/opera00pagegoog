EPODE IX

‘ W7ien, Maecenas, shall we celebrate a triumphal feast in your palaee at
Rome, as we did lately after the defeat of that sea-captain who arm-ed slaves to
destroy Roman freedom? Now Romans sell themselves as slaves to the service
of eunuchs and an eastern queen, althouqh, chafinq at such disqraca even
G'auls deserted to Caesar, and her own fleet refuses to fiqht. Ο Triumpli-qod‚
dost thou delay the triumphal procession, thouqli never hast thou conducted
home so qreat a leader? Ohanqiny liis purple robe for mourninq the conquered
foe is flyinq to lands afar. Boy, brinq larqer qoblets and stronqer wine to
cheele these risiny qualms .· in wine we will sorqet our care and sear for Caesar?

The dramatic scene is at sea on the evening of Sep. 2 Β.0. 31, just after the
battle of Actium, at which Maecenas was present with Horace ; cf. the graphio
sinistrorsum line 20, fluentem nauseam line 35 and Epod. 1 Intr. The language
is not that of assured triumph, but indicates that doubt and uncertainty still
remain (cf. line 1 quando, 21 moraris, 37 curam metumque) as to the final issue.

foreign strains! For the Phrygian music of the pipe (or pipes, for they were
usually double, see illustration in Dict. Ant.) cf. Od. 3. 19. 18 n. 3 it is here
contrasted w-ith the deeper notes of the lyre, the Dorian style of music (ἡ
Δωριστί) being severe and sober, whereas the Phrygian (ἡ Φρυγιστί) was high·
pitched and exciting. The two instruments were continually played together,

torn from perjured slaves.’ He manned his fleet largely with slaves who
deserted (cf. perfidis) to him. The character of his followers is emphasised
because it leads up (servis line 10, servire line 14) to the thought which
follows : Horace had celebrated one feast for a victory over slaves and hopes
to celebrate another. 12. emancipatae. The opposite of our ⁴ emanci-
