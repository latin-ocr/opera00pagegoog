27. saevus inpetus, ‘the fierce onset of setting Arcturus.' When Arcturus
(Ἀρκτοῦρος, the Bear Ward) sets at the end of October, the sea is tempestuous
(tumultuosum) anwoerchant harassed (sollicitat) about his ships. 28.

Zence, the olive. aquas, ‘rains.' 32. sidera: especially the Dogstar.

33. contracta . . . Cf. 3. 24. 3 and 2. 18. 20. Horace refers to the
practice of building villas projecting into the sea : the expression is of course

caementa: from caedo, ‘chippings‚' ‘rubble,' flung in (demitto) to fill up
the spaces between the solid masonry. 36. terrae fastidiosus, ‘sick and

triremi, ‘the bremen-beaked trireme.' The vessel is 11616 clearly a private
one (cf. priva triremis, Ep. 1. 1. 93), used for purposes of pleasure or con-
venience, not a war-vessel. The words triremi and equitem are selected not
merely because ‘yachts’ and ‘horses’ may be thought of as able to distance

’ care by their speed, but also because they are appanages of wealth and

luxury. Cf. 2. 16. 21. 41. Phrygius lapis: a marble from Synnada in
Phrygia, celebrated for its bright blood-red spots, and much used for columns

« 42. purpurarum sidere clarior usus, ‘the wearing of pur-ples (ie. purple

robes, cf. 2. 18. 7) more lustrous than the stars.’ In strict grammar the adj.
clarior ought to agree with purpurarum, but in poetry the transference or
exchange (hypallage) of the adj. from one substantive to another in a closely
connected expression is not uncommon. Cf. Virg. Aen. 8. 526 Tyrrhenusque
tubae clangor: Tyrrhenae tubae clanqor‚ and 2. 14. 27 superbo mero tinquetz
superbus mero linquet, see too 1. 12. 34 superbos Tarquini fasces, 1. 15. 33

61 Troiae renascens fortuna, 3. 21. 19 iratos requm apices, 3. 30. 2 reqalis
situs pyramidum, 4. 7. 21 splendida arbitria. Purple is spoken of as ‘lustrous'
because the true Tyrian dye possessed a peculiar sheen and varied in colour
according to the light in which it was seen, cf. 3. 15. 15 n.
