426 HORACE BOOK 1

4. 72 3 9. 25. legit, perf. simius iste: according to the scholiasts this
was M. DemetriuS, a musician (modulator), who is joined with Hermogenes
line 90. They say he is here called a monkey‚ on account of his ugliness and
small stature3 ef. the contrast with palchen and Arist. Ran. 707 ὁ πίθηκος
οὗτος ὁ νῦν ἐνοχλῶν Ι Κλειγένης ὁ μικρός. Others take simius to mean ‘the ape‚’
i.e. imitator of Hermogenes. 19. C Valerius Catullus (86- 254 B.c.), and
C. Licinius Calvus (82-47) contemporaries and friends, who wrote poetry of
the same sort, chiefly erotic‚ and epigrammatic3 the former one of the
greatest poets of his time: it is difficult to account for Horace's want of
appreciation of him. He violently lampooned Julius Caesar, and his poems
may, for this reason, have found little favour with Octavian; but Horace,
who attacks Tigellius, the friend, and speaks without censure of BrutuS‚ the
murderer of Caesar, is not likely to have been prevented praising a poet
through sear of the disapprobation of Octavian. He imitates Catullus in one
or two passageS, however: cf. 2. 1. 43.

20. Graeca: the fragments of Lucilius contain a good deal of Greek.

it is latent. ‘ O 'you late learned (for are you not so to be named 12), you who
think that a wonderful thing which even the Rhodian Pitholeon achieved.'
22. Pitholeonti: Pitholeon is put for Pitholaus ; so Τιμολέων is derived from
Τιμόλεως, Τιμόλαος. Ηο is said by Suetonius, Caes. 75, to have lampooned
Julius Caesar, and is probably the M. Otacilius Pitholaus mentioned by Ma-
crobius, Saturn. 2. 2. 13. This would make him out to have been the slave
of one Otacilius, whose name he prefixed to his own on manumission. He
was by birth a Rhodian probably. 23. concinnus, ‘ happily blended.’
24. The Chian wines were sweet: Falernian was dry (austerum). nota,
‘brand‚' cf. Od. 2. 3. 8 11. 25. cum . . . Horace asks: ‘Is this admixture
of Greek allowable 111 poetry only, or in speeches in the forum as well 2 ’ (et).-
The supposition would be absurd to a Roman. 26. Petilli, 1. 4. 94.

27. oblitus with malis. patriaeque patrisque : the language of
your fatherland and forefathers is Latin. Latine, ‘in Latin,' cf. Latine
loqui ,· and Latine e. eoesudare is satirical for Latine e. orare. Latini (so .
Orelli4, Kiessling) has better authority and then the reference is to pater
Latinus (cf. Virg. Aen. 7. 61, 92 and the mention of Quirinus in line 32), who
is referred to as the eponymous hero of Latin speech. 28. Pedius Poplicola
supposed by some to have been a brother of the Messalla Corvinus here 111011-
tioned, and to have been adopted by J. Caesar's nephew or great-nephew Q.
Pedius, who was consul suffect. with Octavian 43 B.o., and died that year.
29. corvinus : cf. Od. 3. 21 Intr. The scholiasts tell us he was such a purist,
that he refused to employ the Greek word σχοινοβάτης, and was the first to
use the term ‚funambulus instead for a rope-dancer. 30. foris :pereqra
‘abroad.’ Canusini bilinguis, the inhabitants of Canusium, in Apulia,
had a population partly Greek and partly Oscan, and spoke both languages.
Lucilius and Ennius both' have Bruttaee bilinqui.
