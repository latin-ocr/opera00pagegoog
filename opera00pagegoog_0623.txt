nova succrescant, and Nettleship would consequently read here prima cadunt,
πουα succrescunt. Housman would punctuate prima oculum ica verbmw.
vetus interit aeta-3, el . . . The metaphor is suggested by Homer, Il. 6. 146-149
οἵη περ φύλλων γενεή, τοίη δὲ καὶ ἀνδρῶν. Ι φῦλλα τὰ μέν τ’ ἄνεμος χαμάδις
χέει, ἄλλα δέ θ’ ὕλη Ι τηλεθόωσα φύει, ἔαρος δ’ ἐπιγίγνεται ὥρη · Ι ὣς
ἀνδρῶν ’γενεὴ ἣ μὲν φύει ἣ δ’ ἀπολήγει-3, passage which has found many other
echoes in literature ; cf. Virg. Aen. 6. 309.

63. debemur: cf. Simonides frag. 122 Bergk θανάτῳ πάντες ὀφειλόμεθα,
Ov. Met. 10. 32 omnia debemur vobis (dis inseris). sive receptus, etc. :
the W. coast of Italy was very deficient in good harbourS. Hence when
Sextus Pompeius was threatening Rome with a strong fleet, Agrippa, the
admiral of Augustus found it necessary to construct an artificial port. On
the coast of Campania, between Misenum and Puteoli, there were two small
lakes, the Avernus and the Lucrinus, separated from each other by a strip of
land about a mile in breadth, while the latter, the outer lake, was divided
from the sea by a narrow belt of sand or shingle. Agrippa strengthened this
barrier by facing it with stone, but pierced it with a channel to admit ships,
and also connected the two lakes by a canal, so as to form a safe and capacious
harbour, called the Portus Julius. virgil (G. 2. 161-164) speaks of this work
as one of the glories of Italy. But whether there is any reference to it here,
as is almost universally assumed, is very doubtful: see on line 67 below.
64. arcet: here with the acc. of the thing defended, and the abl. of that
from which it is defended. In prose it is more common to have the acc. of
the thing kept off, and the abl. (with ab) of that from which it is kept off.
65. regis opus: the phrase marks the work as comparable with that of the
Egyptian and Babylonian kings. Meineke would read reyium (cf. reqiae moles
Od. 2. 15. 1), urging that the text must mean ‘the work of one who was a
king‚’ a title always rejected by Augustus, as by Julius. palus diu : the
MSS. read diu palm. Gesner's palas dia (approved by Lachmann), in
which the long vowel is not elided but shortened 111 hiatus, has in its favour
si me amas of S. 1. 9. 38 and Virgil, Ecl. 8. 108 απ qui amant, Aen. 6. 507 ίέ
amice. The hiatus is common in Lucretius and Catullus ε cf. Munro on Lucr.
2. 404. Although we cannot very confidently ascribe it to Horace here,
especially as the instances apparently similar shorten the vowel in the first
not the second thesis, it is less improbable than the shortening of the final
syllable of palas, to which no sort of parallel can be adduced. Hence the
best recent editors admit it. But perhaps Bentley’s palus prius is a safer

correction : PRIV would easily become DIV. The scholiasts refer to the
draining of the Pomptine marshes by Augustus ι Pomptinas paludes Auyustus
exsiccavit et habitabiles reddidit iniecto ayyere lapidum et terrae. But although
Julius Caesar intended to attempt this work (Suet. J ul. 44), and perhaps met with
some partial success, there is no evidence that it was carried out by Augustus

67. seu mireum . . . Porphyrion says Tiberim intellegamus .· hunc
enim Aqm'ppa derivavit, qua nunc vadit: antea per Velabrum fluebat, and
so too Acron. But the Velabrum was drained by the Cloaca Maxima
in the time of the kings, and the Tiber never flowed through it. On
the other hand the three instances of great works of men here mentioned
as perishing are strikingly parallel to what Plut. Caes. 58 says of the
schemes of Julius Caesar: ‘ He had also a design of diverting the Tiber,
and carrying it by a deep channel directly from Rome to Circeii, and so
into the sea near Tarracina . . . - Besides this he intended to drain all the
