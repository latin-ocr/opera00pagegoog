27. punico. The reference is to the purple paludamentum of a Roman
general. It is sometimes called saqum punam-eum to distinguish it from the
sayum megale of the common soldier, which Antony here adopts as a sign of
mourning. 28. mutavit, ‘ has taken in exchange‚’ cf. Od. 1. 17. 2 11. 29.

34. chia. Of. Od. 1. 17. 21 n. It and Lesbian were light wines, whereas
Caecuban was strong and εὐστόμαχον, 30 that Horace suggests it ‘to keep in
check the rising bile! The old explanation was that the party were beginning
to have drunk too much, but Orelli's 4111 edition rightly accepts Biicheler's
view that Horace describes himself as really at sea and really uneasy, though
the actual physica] uneasiness is meant also to suggest the mental uneasiness
which is troubling him, cf. lines 36, 37. 37. rerum: obj. gen. ‘sear for
Caesar's fortuneS.' 38. Lyaeo ε from λύω (Od. 3. 21. 15 11.), 30 that solvere

EPODE X

A humor-ons antithesis to Od. 1. 3 and so affording proof—if proof is needed
—that the Virgil there mentioned is the poet Virgil. Horace prays all the
winds to fall upon the ship which is conveying Maevius (probably to Greece)
and to stir up such a storm as fell on the Greek fleet when returning from
Troy 3 he pictures to himself how Maevius will shriek and pray, and vows, if
116 is only drowned, to offer suitable victims to the Tempests. Maevius was
a poetaster chiefly known from Virgil's line, Ecl. 3. 90 qui Bavium non odit,
amet tua camina, Maevi. ’

1. mala . . . alite. Cf. 16. 23 secunda alite ; Od. 1. 15. 5 n. soluta,
‘ unmoored.' 3. ut: in wishes fi‘om ‘ familiar speech '——later utinam,
4. memento: parenthetic. Auster, (5) Eume, (7) Aquilo. Of. Od. 1.
3. 4, where all the winds, except Iapyx, which would waft the ship to Dyr-
rachium, are kept imprisoned: here all the winds which would hinder the
voyage are to be let loose. 7. quantus . . . ‘ mighty as when on mountain
heights he snaps the quivering oaks.' 9. sidus amicum. Without the
stars the ancients could not steer, ancl on the stormy night ‘when baleful
Orion sets ' they would be especially needed 3 cf. Acts xxvii. 20. 10. tristis
Orion : cf. 15. 7 and Od. 1. 28. 21 n.

13. cum . . . Pallas was ‘angry' with Troy because of the judg-
ment of Paris, but when AJax, son of 0116113, outraged Cassandra in her
temple during the sack of Troy, she ‘ turned her anger away from Ilium in
ashes against the impious bark of Ajax‚' and caused a violent storm 10 fall
upon the Greek fleet during which Ajax perished 3 cf. Virg. Aen. l. 39 seq.;
Aesch. Ag. 6503 Hom. Od. 4. 499. 16. pallor luteus: Homer's χλωρὸν
δέος. Τ116 ‘ paleness ' of an Italian complexion is ‘ yellow ’ rather than ‘ white.'
Hence pallor is used of gold, and pallentes violas (Virg. Ecl. 2. 47) probably
of wall-flowers, cf. 011. 3. 10. 14 11.

stretched a noble prey upon the curving shore you shall feast the gulls . . .'
