346 HORACE Boox lv

when he finally withdrew from public life, a coolness had sprung up between
the ‚Emperor and the minister, so that his name could hardly be mentioned
frequently in a Book written specially at Augustus' request.

2. Albani: reekoned second only to> Falernian. 3. nectendis apium
coronis, ‘ parsley for weaving chaplets ' z this use of. the dat. of the gerundive
to express a purpose is chiefly found in legal phrases, e.g. IIIviri ayris divi-
dendiS, ‘a body of three land commissioners‚’ Xviri Zeyibas scribendis, ‘a
body of ten men for drawing up 1aws.’ Virg. G. 1. 3 has cultus habendo
pecori ; 2. 9 arboribus natura creandis, ‘method for rearing trees! For this
use of parsley, ef. 1. 36. 16; Virg. Ecl. 6. 68. 4. vis multa, ‘much
abundance.’ 5. qua crines . . . ‘which binding back thy hair sets off
thy beauty.' The Latin with inimitable terseness expresses that the hair was
drawn back and fastened with a wreath of ivy, the effect of this simple orna-
ment being to bring out in full relies the brilliancy (cf. fedqes) of Phyllis’
beauty. ¹7. verbenis: 1. 19. 14 n. avet inmolato . . . ‘longs to
be sprinkled with the sacrifice of a lamb.’ sparyier is an archaic form of the
inf. passive only found here in the Odes.

9. manus, ‘band,' i.e. of slaves, further defined in line 10 as mixtae
pueris puellae. The invitation is doubtless to Horace's Sabine farm, cf. in
horto, line 2. 11. sordidum flammae . . . ‘the flames quiver as they
whirl the sooty smoke in eddies ' : sordidum is graphio and suggests a contrast
with the bright glimmer of the flames. trepidant: 2. 4. 23 n. 14.
Idus . . . ‘you are to keep the Ides, the day . . .' The Ides were on the
13th of every month except March, May, July, and October, when they were
on the 15th. 15. mensem Veneris marinae. The month being sacred
to Venus adds fitness to his invitation. Ov. Fast. 4. 61 derives Aprilis from
Ἀφροδίτη, because in that month Venus rose from the foam (ἀφρός) of the
sea: sed Veneris mensem G'raio sermone notatum Ι augum-om· a spumis est dea
dicta marie. The real derivation is from aperio ‘ the mouth of the opening‚'
qaia ver aperit tunc omnia (Fast. 4. 87). 16. findit. The ancients con-
nected Idus with divido, or an Etruscan word idao of the same meaning.

18. natali: used as a subst. without die. 19. adfluentes . . . ‘reckons
the on-gliding years? adfluentes admirably describes the way in which each
succeeding year silently glides on (fluere) and is added (ad) to the tale of
those already past. 20. ordinat, lit. ‘places in a row,' i. e. each birthday
adds one to the row of figures which marks the number of his years. 21.
occupavit, ‘has made her own? 22. non . . . ‘a youth of fortunes
other than yours’: sorsza man's ‘lot' or position in life. 23. grata
compede. Oxymoron, cf. 3. 11. 35 11. ·

25. avaras spes, ‘ greedy ’ or ‘ ambitious hopes.' There is ⁶ a half comio
irony' (Wickham) in the mythological instances which Horace selects as a
warning to Phyllis. 26. exemplum grave, ‘ a weighty warning.' The
use of yravatus in the next line seems to have no reference to yrave here but
to be purely accidental. 27. gravatus, ⁶ disdaining the burden of an
earth-bom rider.' yravari ‘ to treat as a weight,' ‘hardship,’ or ‘ grievance ' ;
hence accurately of a horse which obJects to its burden and gets rid of it.
29. ut: aster exemplum praebet, ‘gives a warning so that you should seek a
fitting partner! et ultra . . . the construction is ei disparem vites nefas
putando sperare ultra quam licet .· ‘and shun an unequal match by thinking
it unholy to hope for more than is permitted.' 33. non alia calebo
femina, ‘110 other woman shall fire me with love.' For calere with abl.=
