69. scribe decem a Nerio: the general sense is clear3 no legal
formulae are strong enough to bind a dishonest debtor. Two interpreta-
tions are given according as (1) tabulas is supplied with decem, or (2)
sestertia understood. (1) Perellius in 75 is a money-lender‚ who lends
money to Damasippus. He is the person addressed in scribe. Nerius is
Perellius's banker. Cicuta (= ‘ hemlock‚' a slang name) is a second
money-lender‚ more cautious even than Perellius. scribere is said of the
creditor paying out money which at the same time he ‘ enters ' in his ledgers‚
this act of expensilatio being evidence of the loan. But a still further act of
security was to enter the money as paid through. a hamster, a Nerio, here. In
such cases, a or ab was used with the name of the person on whom the pay-
ment was charged: cf. Plaut. Cure.. 5. 2. 20 solvi ab trapessita meo ; Cic. ad Att.

praetor dedit, a quaestore numerabit, quaestor a publiea mensa. Perellius not
only enters the loan in his own books, but dictates (dictat line 76) to his
banker to make a similar entry in his books: hence greater security is
obtained. Translate: ‘ Enter “ ten sestertia paid out by Nerius ” z that will
not be enough ; add 6 hundred documents (tabulas, a general word, including
synqraphae, ‘ notes of hand ³), such 63 1116 knotty money-lender Cicuta
employs ; add a thousand fetters, that Proteus of a borrower will evade them
all.' (2) Under-standing tabulas with Orelli and Ritter, the words are supposed

to be addressed to the rash creditor: ‘Write out (for the borrower to sign) -

ten bonds after the form employed by Nerius (a usurer): ’tis not enough:
add a hundred bonds of the knotty Cicuta: add a thousand fetters: that
Proteus of a borrower will elude them all.' Orelli supplies dictatas with a
Ner-ie, quoting Cic. ad Att. 16. 7. 7 Antonii edictum leyi a Erato (30. acceptum) :
but the letters of Cicero are full of strong ellipses of the verb or participle,
which are not admissible in Horace. The chief argument for this view is that,
