Evlsrnn 11 NOTES 575

36. mentem, ‘vigour,’ ‘spiriu' cf. 1. 2. 60 11. 40. zonam: for the
custom of carrying money iu a belt cf. the passage from a speech by Gaius
Gracchus, preserved in Gell.15. 12 cum Romam profectas sum, zontas, quas
plenas amenti extuli, eas ecc provincia inanes rettuli. This practice does not
seem to be mentioned in classical Greek3 but cf. Matt. x. 9 μὴ κτήσησθε
χρυσὸν μηδὲ ἄργυρον μηδὲ χαλκὸν εἰς τὰς ζώνας υμῶν, Livy 33. 29. 4 neqotiandi
senne causa amentum in zonis habentes commatibus erant.

41. contigit: cf. l. 2. 46 n. doceri . . .‚ ic. he studied Homer,
according to the established rule in schools ; cf. Quint. 1. 8. 5 optime institutum
est ut ab Homero atque Vergilio lectio inciperet ,· Pliny, Ep. 2. 14. 2 in foro
pueros α centumviralibus causis auspicari ut ab Homero in scholis. 43.
bonae agreeing with Athenae ‘kind,' almost equivalent to grato 11010111.
Others, not so well, connect the word with artie, cf. Tac. Ann. 1. 3. 4 A yrippam

rudem bonarmn artium. 44. vellem: MSS. vary here between vellem,
possim, and possem: the first has the most authority, while the last (though
preferred by many good recent editors) has the least. rectum carries with

it the mathematical sense of a ‘right' line, as well as the moral sense3 and
hence is opposed to curvus: so pravus originally means ‘ffcrooked and our

‘'wrong is what is ‘wrung 'aside or perv erted. Skeat quotes from Wyclif

‘wrung nose' for ‘crooked nose.’ Persius 4.12 again imitates Horace:
rectum discernis, ubi inter 1 curva subit, vel cum fallit pede reyula varo. 45.
silvas Academi. cf. Eupolis frag. 32 Mein. ἐν εὐσκίοις δρόμοισιν Ἀκαδήμου
θεοῦ. The enclosure sacred to the hero Academus lay about three· ·quarters of
a mile outside the walls of Athens on the road which ran through the Outer
Ceramicus to Colonus. Its olive groves and plane· -trees were famous. they
were planted by Cimon, for ‘the Academy, which was before a bare, dry and
dirty spot, he converted into a well- watered grove, with shady alleys to walk
in, and open courses for races’ (Plutarch, Cimon 13). Sulla in his siege of
Athens 18 said to have cut down the trees, but they must have been replanted
by this time. Plato had been wont to teach there, a custom followed by his
successors (cf. Cic. de Fin. 5. 1. 2), and when Horace was at Athens the head
of the Academic school was Theomnestus, whose lectures Brutus attended after
the murder of Caesar (Plut. Brut. 24). The expression however seems to be
here a general one for the study of philosophy: Horace nowhere shows any
special attachment to the Academic doctrines, being rather an Epicurean with
occasional leanings to some Stoic views.

46. dura tempora, i.c. the struggles between the murderers and the
avengers of Caesar. emovere, ‘ tore me away? Brutus induced Horace
to follow him into Asia3 cf. S. 1. 7. 18; 6. 48. 47. civilisque . . .
The order is civilisque aestus (l. 2. 8) tulit (me) medem belli in arma non
responsura etc. 48. caesaris Augusti ε 80 united only here by Horace :
Virgil has the title twice, Aen. 6. 7933 8. 678. responsura, ‘fated to
proveamatch for’: cf. S. 2. 7. 85 responsare cupidinibus, · ib. 103, · 2.4. 18,
a usage apparently confined to Horace. 49. unde: ab armis. simul
primum: a rare combinatiom rejected by Drakenborch on Livy 6.1. 6
interim Q. Fabio simul primum myistratn abiit, dies dicta est, and pro·
nounced ‘everywhere suspicions ’ by Draeger, Hist. Synt. 2. 573; but
sufficiently established by this passage. simul ac primum is used by Cic. in
Verr. Act. 2. 1. 13. 34, and by Suet. 0308. 30 ; Νο1·0 43. Horace did not, like
Pompeius Varus and other of his friends, join the forces of Sextus Pompeius
and continue the struggle, but gave up arms at once. 50. inopem:
