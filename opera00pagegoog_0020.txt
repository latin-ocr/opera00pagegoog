xiv HORACE

The Odes may be roughly divided into two classes according as
they are of a light or of a serious character. The former deal
with love, wine, friendship3 the latter are addressed to some
eminent personage or are written ‘ by command ' to celebrate
some public event or advocate some public policy. The one
exhibit grace, polish, elegance3 the other aim at imposing
stateliness and sonorous dignity. The two varieties are wholly
different, and it would be as foolish to compare the lyrics of
Herrick or Sir John Suckling with, say, Tennyson's Ode on the
Death of the Duke of Wellington as to compare such exquisite
gems as 1. 5 (Quis multa...) or 3. 9 (Donec ψαύω...) with the
Roman-Odes at the commencement of the third Book.

The characteristics of the Odes are (1) their wonderful charm
of rhythm, and (2) their perfect literary finish. With regard to
the first point, Horace was proudly conscious 1 of the skill with
which he had overcome the difficult task of adapting Greek
metres to the requirements of the Latin tongue. To examine
in detail how far he has succeeded would require a treatise, but
any one who will compare his Alcaics with those of Alcaeus 2
will see that his Alcaic stanza is, though a copy, at the same
time almost a new creation, the stately third line especially, which
bears the weight of the stanza, being so changed that its
original trochaic movement (see quotation in note) is hardly
recognisable. The lofty ring and rhythmic force of Horace’s best
Odes in this metre have never been approached.

The literary finish of the Odes has been acknowledged in all
ages. Their apparently happy ease is really the result of infinite
painS.3 Horace had no belief in geniuses who dash off verses.
The poet must have natural power (inqenium), but technical
skill (ars) 4 is also indispensable, and above all pains: ‘correct,' ⁵
‘erase,' 6 ‘ polish,' ⁷ ‘ prune,' 8 is Horace's constant cry 3 ‘give back
the verses to the anvil,'9 ‘lock them up in your desk for nine
