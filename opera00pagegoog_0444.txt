SATIRE VII

A repartee made in Brutzw’s Gou‘rt at Clazomenae. DATE, 43 01542 110.

Apparently the earliest 01 311 1113 extant compositions of Horace. The
event it, describes happened in the year 43 or 42 B.o., at which time M.
Brutus, the tyrannicide, was acting as propraetor in Asia, and it seems to have
been composed at the time, or shortly after3 certainly before the battle 01

. Philippi. This 13 probable for several reasonS. There is no allusion to the

sad fate 01 Brutus: the murder 01 Caesar would be an unhappy subject to ’
J'oke about if the power of Octavian, his heir, was established at Rome: the
mention in line 18 of Brutus' s usurpation as a regular praetorship looks as if
his power was as yet not overthrown. Besides this, though the poor pun
celebrated might at the time it was uttered be deemed worthy of a poetic ,
dress -jokes in court always excite unbounded admiration— to recur to it
after years would show weakness and silliness 01 mind.

noted. pus atque venenum, 3 periphrasis like virtus Catonia eta, ‘the

say his father was an Asiatic, his mother a Roman. The word hybrida (also
spelt hibrida, ibrida) is generally connected with ὕβρις, but Kiessling refers to
a gloss of Philoxenus iber ἡμίονος, and to imbri the name 01 cross-bred sheep in
