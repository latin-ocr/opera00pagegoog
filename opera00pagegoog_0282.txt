ODE VIII

⁷ An Ode to Barine, fair, fickle and forsworn. Perhaps this is the only Ode
of which there is an adequate English rendering—that by Sir Oharles Sedley
(see Selected Translations‚ by C. W. Cooper).

1. ulla . . . umquam, ‘had any punishment, Barine‚ for saith forsworn
ever marred your beauty.' The ancients believed that the gods specially
punished ,perjury by the infliction of personal disfigurement ; Ov. Am. 3. 3. 1
esse deos i, crede ; fidem iurata fefellit .· Ι et facies illi, quae fuit ante, manet.
iuris perier-ati : ius is never used by itself for ‘ an oath,' but from the analogy
of its use in iusiurandum Horace has invented this phrase,. which is at once
so clear and effective that it is a distinct addition to the Latin language. For
the oxymoron, cf. 3. 11. 35 n. 3. nigro 11110. Βο111 adJ'ectives go with
both dente and unyui,· uno is emphatic, one sinqle.

5. crederem. N otice the contrast between the long protasis and the em-
phatic monosyllabic apodosis. Had I, he means to say, one atom of hope that
you might possibly keep your word, then I would, spite 01 everything, then and
there, unreasonably and unhesitatingly believe. tu: emphatic. simul
:simul ae, ‘as soon as.' obligasti : 01. 2. 7. 17 11. 6. caput. It was
customary to ‘swear by the head ’ (cf. St. Matt. v. 36), i.e. invoking a curse on
the head 11 1116 oath were broken ε hence Horace’s selection of the word here.
But he is not uninfluenced by the recollection how charming was that same
‘perjured head‚’ ‘ wreathed ¹ though it was ‘ with broken vows ' (votis obliqa-
tum). enitescis . . . cura, ‘you shine forth in still more radiant beauty,
and advance the cynosure of all our youth.’ enitescis and prodis admirably
describe Barine's soft and dazzling beauty as she appears: they are words·
that might be used of the rising moon as she ‘unveils her peerless light?

9. expedit : emphatic. Not only does perjury do you no harm but
it absolutely ‘suits you ’ ! 10. fallere, ‘to deceive‚' i.e. ‘to swear falsely
by ² ; cf. Virg. Aen. 6. 324 di euius iurare timent et fallere numen, and the
common fidem fallere ⁴ to break a pledge.' et toto . . . carentes.
Horace heaps together words 01 weight and solemnity to express the awfulness
of the oaths Barine had broken. 13. hoc, i. e. the fact of your per-jury.
N otice the climax ε 1101 only does Barine not suffer for her perjury‚ but it ab·
solutely does her good, nay the deities even smile approbation of it. inquam:
J'ust as we insert ‘ I assure you ' when we think what we are saying may appear
incredible. 15. ardentes: burning arrows were frequently used in war ε
Cupid's are so called because they kindle ‘ the fire ¹ of love.

17. adde quod: poetical for aceedit quod,⁸ ‘then too there is the fact
