236 HORACE BOOK 1

ODE XXXV

‘ O Queen of Antium, thou all-powerful qoddess Fortune, thee the poor man
supplicates ancl the sailor‚ thee the nations worship, ancl the mothers of princes
ancl even Icinys in all their ylory fearful lest thou shouldst overthrow their
prosperity. Before thee onarches Destiny with all the symbols of her immutable
power: with thee are H ope anol Goool Faith, faithful, even when thou hast
ceaseol to smile ancl the vulqar herol of flatterers has deserted the unfortunate.
Oh ,Ι do thou quarcl the Emperor in his attaek on Britain and our armies in the
East .· may these legitimate wars expiate our unholy civil contentionS, may
Roman sworols no longer be whetted but a9ainst a foreiyn foe.'

Fortune in this-{Ode is not the capricious goddess of 3. 29. 49-—luolum
insolentem ludere pertinax—but that mysterious power which rules the change-
ful phases of human life. At line 29 this general conception is specialised
and the prayer is addressed to that Fortuna populi Romani of whose power
the Romans were reminded whenever they recalled the history of the growth
of their world-wide empire. Cf. Plutarch de Fortuna Romanorum, c. 4
(quoted by Wickham) ‘ even as Aphrodite, when she crossed the EurotaS,
laid aside her mirror and her ornaments and her cestus, and took spear and
shield to adorn herself for Lycurgus’ eyes, so when, after her soJourning with
Persians and Assyrians, with Macedonians and Carthaginians, she (Τύχη) ap-
proached the Palatine and crossed the Tiber‚ she laid aside her wings and took
off her sandals and left behind her her ball, the symbolos fickleness and change?

1. gratum, sc. tibi, as 1. 30. 2 dilectam Cypron. Antium: on the
coast, capital of the Volsci. There were two statues of Fortune there
(Fortunae Antiates) which were consulted by drawing lots (per sortes).
2. praesens, ‘ready and able.’ praesens implies not merely ‘ presence,'
but also being present with the wish and ability to assisia. Hence
the inf. after it. vel: ‘eveu’ 3. mortale corpus, ‘frail mortals ’z
used instead of ‘men,' to emphasise the weakness and frailty of humanity.
5. ambit, lit. ‘to go round canvassing' (hence ambitio), then ‘to court,’
‘ worship.‘ 6. dominam aequoris, ‘ as mistress of the ocean? 7.
Bithyna, Carpathium. Pictoria13 cf. l. 1. 13 n. lacessit: ‘ chal-
lenges‚’ ‘braves.’ The word expresses the hardihood of the sailor 3 cf. 1. 3.
21—24. 8. Carpathium pelagus x between Rhodes and Crete.

11. regumque matres. Anxious for their sons who had gone to battle.
Cf. the lament of Atossa the mother of Xerxes, Aesch. Pers· 163, and Judges
v. 28 ‘ The mother of Sisera looked out at a window‚ and cried through the
lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his
chariots 3’ 12. purpurei. Not an idle epithet ; kings ‘ even in their royal

’ purple ’ fear Fortune. Purple is the distinguishing mark of kingly dignity, cf.

Virg. G. 2. 495 purpura requm, and purple-striped togas were the sign of
rank at Rome during the republic. Subsequently garments wholly of purple
(holoverae) were reserved to the Emperor alone. For the history of purple
see Mayor on Juv. 1. 27. 13. iniurioso . . . ‘lest with aggressive foot
thou shouldst overthrow the standing pillar (of the State), lest the thronging
populace should rouse even the hesitating to arms, to arms, and break their
sceptro! iniurioso: ὑβριστικῷ, combines the ideas of insult and injury:
pede increases the idea of insult. 14. colu-mna is used as an emblem
of stability and dignity. neu . . . This second clause repeats with
fresh particulars the idea of the first. 15. cessantes=those at first
