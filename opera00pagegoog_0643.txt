Pon'rreA ⁷ NOTES 615

patience: ‘you might have told me by this time ’ ; cf. Roby 1535, S. G. 643·
θυεεΰ, often used by the comic poets in approval. 329. redit, ‘is added '
sc. to the quincunx: it denotes the opposite of the previous action, not merely
its reversal. flt, ‘ is the amount!

330. an : so vet. Bland. and a few others ; most have ad which points to
at, but an introducing a question which cannot be answered is better.
aerugo, used in S. 1. 4. 101 of the canker of malice, here denotes the canker
of avarice. Properly it is the rust upon copper coin. 331. speramus
has more authority than speremus; as Bentley says ‘ utrumque probum est, ut
nescias utrum uiri praeferendum sit? 332. cedro, the resinous exudation
of the cedrus or juniper-tree, was used to preserve books from decay: it was
smeared on the unwritten side of the roll 3 cf. Vitruv. 2. 9. 13 ex cedro oleum,
quod cedrium dicitur, nascitur, quo reliquae res ariciae, uti etiam libri, a tineis
et a carie non laeduntwr,· Ov. Trist. 3. 1. 13 quod neque sum cedro flavus nec
vumice levis ,· Pers. 1. 42 has cedro diqna locutus. cupresso: cf. Schol.
Cruq. cupressus autem est cedri species, unde confici solent capsulae, in quibus
reponebantur scripta poetarum contra tineas.

333-365 (quid deceat, quid non). A poet must bc brief, not extravayant,
and neither empty nor too severe. Some slips may be pardoned ; and a poem
must be judyed as a whole ; and win reyard to its general style. 335.
brevis: Horace is himself one of the first masters of the terse speech that
sticks. 336. dociles and fideles are predicates and may be translated
best by adverbs. 339. ne, the reading of most MSS„ though some give
nec, is final, not imperative. velit has the support of the better MSS„
but many of the best editors prefer volet. 340. Lamiae: Lamia was
said to be a beautiful queen beloved by Zeus, but bereft of all her children
by Hera, whereupon she retired into a lonely cavern in the midst of wild
rocks, and there became a treacherous and greedy monster devouring 1110
children of others from spite; cf. Aristoph. Pac. 758; Vesp. 1035, 1177.
Τ110 word is derived from λάμος, ‘ maw‚' with which is connected λάμιαε
χάσματα. extrahat, i.e. describe how it is drawn.

341. centuriae seniorum: consisting, in each division of the Servian
classification, of those who were over forty·five years os age. These older men
cared nothing for plays which had no useful lessons in 1110111. 342.
Ramnes: the first of the three original centur-ies of knightS, the other two
being Tities and Luceres (Livy 1. 13). The term refers only to knights equo
publico, who served as cavalry, and not to those who belonged to the ordo
'equester by virtue of their census; and the period of service sor cavalry was
limited to ten campaigns, so that all these equites would be under thirty.
celsi, ‘haughty,’ whether we take it as an epithet, or as an adverbial predicate
with praetereunt3 cf. Livy 7. 16 celsi et feroces in proelium vadunt. 343.
punctum: cf. Ep. 2. 2. 99 n. 345. Sosiis: cf. Ep. 1. 20. 23 the book
pays the publishers. mare transit: here just in the opposite sense to
Ep. 1. 20. 13 (cf. note). Martial was read in Gaul, Spain, and Britain, and
complains that he gets no profit from his British readers (11. 3. 6.) Pliny,
Ep. 9. 11, is delighted to find that his works have a good sale at Lugdunum.
346. longum prorogat, ⁶ extends to a distant day,' proleptic: as Soph.
Trach. 679 μείζον’ ἐκτενῶ λόγον.

348. nam neque . . . just as the string of a lyre may give the wrong
note, or a bow miss its mark, so a man cannot always produce the result at
which he aims. 350. quodcumque minabitur ι sc. ferire ; minor here
