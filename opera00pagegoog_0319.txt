⁶ γοα may be sure,' ‘ doubtless‚' is frequently used ironically. acrior,
‘keener for the fray.' 27. damnum. Orelli says ‘not the loss of the
ransom ' but the ‘damage which would accrue from such a precedent.’ But
damnum certainly refers to aur0‚· Regulus of course does not mean ‘Think
too of the money it will cost‚' but he uses the words in bitter irony, just as 116
had used the mercantile words auro ‘repensus (‘handed back over the counter
for due weight of gold '): ‘if,’ he says, ‘ you care not for the disgrace (flayiiium)
of such traffic‚ at any rate buy something worth what γοα pay for it‚' which he
then shows (lines 27-36) these soldiers are not. cf. Eur. RheS. 102 αἰσχρὸν ’γὰρ
ἡμῖν καὶ πρὸς αἰσχύνῃ κακόν. amissos colores, i.e. its pristine purity and

whiteneSS. 28. medioata fuco, ‘tinctured with dye.’ medicare, ‘ to
doctor‚' is common: ‘to dye ' : cf. φαρμάσσειν,
29. semel: ἅπαξ, ‘once,’ once sor au? 30. curat . . . ‘cares to

be restored to the degraded.’ deteriores fiunt ea: boni8‚ peiores ex malie, says
the Scholiast. 32. ille. Scornfully emphatic. 33. perfidis: in
opposition to credidit. (cf. 3. 7. 13 perfida credulum, 3. 27. 25 doloso credidit)
and also with a special reference to the ‘ perfidy ’ which without reason was
always attributed by Roman writers to the Carthaginians‚ ay. Livy attributes
to Hannibal perfidia plus quam Punica. Cf. 4. 4. 49 perfidus Hannibal, and
the well-known perfide Albion. 35. restrictis lacertiS, ‘ with arms bound
behind his back.' Cf. line 22. 36. sensit: of feeling anything painful,
cf. 2. 7. 9 11. iners, ‘spiritless,' used of dull sluggish cowardice, cf. 4. 9.
29 inertia )( virtus.

37. hic . . . ‘he, ignorant whence to win life, confounded peace with
war.' hic picks up the scornful ille of 32 and seems to point out the very
wretch whom Regulus takes as a type of the disgraced troops. unde
vitam sumeret puts into oblique narration the soldier's thought unde vitam

sumam? The answer ought to have been ‘ By the sword.' 38. pacem
duello miscuit: the soldier forgot that in war there should be no ‘bar-
gaining‚' no such peaceful methods of settlement. duello. Cf. Ep. 1. 2. 7 n.
40. altior ruinis, ‘towering higher by,’ or ⁶ on the ruins of Italy.'

41. fertur. Here Regulus' speech ends, and the narrative recommences.
fertur marks the conduct of Regulus as ‘ almost incredible’ (Kiessling) and
sabulous in its heroism, cs. 1. 7. 23; 16. 133 3. 20. 13. 42. ut capitis
minor. Horace alters to a more poetical shape the legal phrase capite
deminutus. caput is the full body of rights possessed by a Roman citizen,
viz. those of liberty, citizenship, and family (libertatis, civitatis, familiae) : the
loss of any of these, ay. os liberty as in the case of Regulus, involved deminutio
capitis. Being therefore no longer a full citizen, Regulus considered himself
to have forfeited also the position of pater familiae, or ‘head of the household.’
capitis is the so·called gen. of respect ; cf. militiae inpiger, inieqer vitae, seri
studiorum, etc. 44. torvus, ‘ grimly.'

45. donec: with posuisse. He fixed his gaze grimly on the ground ‘ until
his weighty words might confirm· the wavering fathers with counsel such as
never before was given ²: after that he recovered his Roman calmness as
described in lines 49-56. For donec with subj. cf. S. 2. 1. 73. 46. auctor
(πρωί auyei) is one who ‘gives strength ' to anything ; hence the ‘author,'
‘ supporter ’ of a proposal: but there often attaches to it, as here, a collateral
notion that the person to whom it is applied possesses auctoritas, that his
character lends weight to his words. Orelli says that consilio is emphatic ;
that whereas a senator had a right sententiam dicere ‘to declare his Judgment‚’
