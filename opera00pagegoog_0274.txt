struck in the emphatic moriture, line 4. Compare Eccl. xi. 7, 8 ‘Truly the
light is sweet, and 3 pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun z but

the days of darkness 3 for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.'

1. rebus in arduis, ‘ when life’s path is steep‚' Wickham. 2. non
830118, ‘and equally so.’ 3. insolenti, ‘excessive,’ ‘extravagant': it is
not all gaiety, but extravagant gaiety, that is to be chastened by the thought
of death. 4. moriture in this striking position assigns the reason 101 1113
advice that has been given ; 31. 1. 28. 6 morituro.

9. quo . . ‚quid‚ ‘to what purpose (cf. Ep. 1. 5. 12) 3133 . . . why

. .2’ i. 3. -11 we are not to enjoy them, why is nature so lavish 01 1131
beauties? quo for quid has strong MS. support, and seems due to an idea
that this stanza 13 grammatically connected with the next, and that quo . . .
quo anticipate huc in line 13—‘ bring hither, boy, to 1113 place where . . .
where . . .' But this is very prosaic, and the scansion quo obliquo without
parallel in Ho'race. pinus ingens albaque populus, ‘ The double
contrast between the slight poplar white in the wind and the gloom 01 1113
heavier pine is indicated, after Horace's manner, by one epithet with each 01
1113 pair of substantives.'—Wickham. 10. consociare amant, ‘ love to
intertwine 3 hospitable shade.' For the epexegetic inf. here and in line 12
cf. 1. 15. 27 11. 11. obliquo. The channe] winds and twists, and so the

same flower that smiles to-day, Ι To—morrow will be dying.’ 15. res,
