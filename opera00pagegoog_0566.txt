538 HORACE Boon 1

indication of its date, unless perhaps in writing line 33 Horace had in mind the
triumph of Augustus in 29 B.c. But in any case the Epistle must have
been written after that date. Some critics have found grievous fault with the
tone which Horace here adopts. But it does not come to much more than
this, that a cynic's life is not necessarily the best, and that modesty is the best
policy ε 110 very degrading doctrine, if not ideally elevated..

1-5. I will give you some advice, Scaeva, as your elder, though I know you
do not need it. 1. consulis: 1. 14. 6 11. 2. tandem z for the rare use
of the impatient interrogative tandem in indirect questions, cf. 010. 031. 3. 20.
72 quaerenti qua tandem re fretus sibi obsisteret. uti, ‘to associate with ’=
χρῆσθαι. 3. docendus with amiculus: it would be superfluous, if re-
ferred to Scaeva. The diminutive=‘ your humble friend.' 4. aspice
siquid: Roby 1754, S. G. 748. 5. cures=velia For the perf. inf.
cf. A. P. 983 S. 2. 3. 187; 1110 construction is archaic and poetic, not in

Cicero or Caesar.

6-12. C'lzoose the line of life which has most attractione sor you. There is
much to be said sor a life of retirement, as well as for one of sels-advanoement.
6.λ primam in horam 2 the client would have to be up and out before sun-
rise, in order that he might greet his patron betimes: cf. Mart. 4. 8. 1 prima
salutantes atque altera conterit hora. 8. laedit: most MSS. have laedet,
a careless assimilation to iubebo. Ferentinum, a lonely place in the
Hemican country, according to the Schol. Oruq. municipium viae Labicanae
ad xlviii lapidem. The town is often mentioned by Livy: Horace evidently
speaks of it as a proverbially quiet place, although the extant remains show
that it was a considerable town. There is no mention of it in history after
211 B.0.‚ so that it may have been a decaying place in the time of Horace.
10. fefellit, ‘has passed 0000110011,’;λέληθεν. Cf. 1. 18. 103 ; Ovid, Trist.
3. 4. 25 crede mihi bene qui latuit, bene viaeit .· both Horace and Ovid borrow
the thought from the saying ascribed to Epicurus, λάθε βιώσας. 11. prod.-
esse tuis: cf. line 46. 12. siccus: not quite, as in 1. 19. 9; Od. 1.
18. 33 4. 5. 39 ; S. 2. 3. 281, ‘sober,’ but rather ‘hungry’ as in S. 2. 2. 14 ;
cf. faucibus siccis of hungry wolves in Virg. Aen. 2. 358. ad. unctum:
Oomm. Cruq. explains pauper et tenuis ad opulentum et locupletem. But it is
very doubtful whether rinctus applied to persons ever has this force. On the
other hand unctum is used several times for ‘a rich meal': cf. A. P. 422;
Pers. 6. 16 cenare sine uncto ‚· so 1. 15. 44 melius et unctius. Hence it 13
better taken here too as neuter. Kiessling gives unctus-:unquentis delibutus.

13-42. A life such as Aristippus led is pleasant and profitable (13-22), fits
a mansor any position (23-32), and is no dishonour (33-42). 13. si pran-
deret holus . . . The story is told by Diog. Laert. 2. 8. 68 παριόντα
ποτὲ αὐτὸν (Ἀρίστιππον) λάχανα πλύνων Διογένης ἔσκωψε καὶ φησίν, εἰ ταῦτα
ἔμαθες προσφέρεσθαι, οὐκ ἂν τυράννων αὐλὰς ἐθεράπευες. ὀ δὲ καὶ σύ, εἶπεν,
εἴπερ ᾔδεις ἀνθρώποις ὁμιλεῖν, οὐκ ἂν λάχανα ἔπλυνες. pranderet, simply
‘ make a meal of,' as S. 2. 3. 245, with no special reference to the prandium.
patienter, ‘ contentedly.’ regibus: the words of Diog. Laert. show that
we need not take this here: ‘the wealthy,’ as in S. 1. 2. 86 : the reference is
to Dionysius the elder, at whose court Aristippus spent some time. 14.
si sciret regibus uti: Orelli quotes the saying of Epicurus (Diog. Laert.
10. 121) καὶ μόναρχον ἐν καιρῷ θεραπεῦσαι τὸν σοφόν. 15. utrius: Horace
has illius always with the exception of S. 1. 10. 67, and so alterius, utrius,
utriusque, ullius, 'unius (but unius in Od. 4. 9. 390), nullius (but nullius in
