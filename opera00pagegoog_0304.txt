276 HORACE Boon 11 onn xx

carmina non prius audita. 2. liquidum aethera: the epithet liquidus
is applied to aether, either with reference to its being ⁶ translucent ' like water,
or ‘yielding ' like all fluids (cf. Milton’s ‘the buxom air,’ where ‘buxom‚' the
German ‘beugsam‚’ means ‘yielding '). 4. invidiaque maior, ‘and
soaring high above envy.'

5. pauperum sanguis parentum, ‘ the offspring 01 lowly parents?
The phrase is employed in close connexion with invidia 111 11110 4 : Horace was
the son of a freedman (libertinus), and the meanness of his birth was a favourite
subject for the sneers of those who were jealous (invidi) of his social and
poetical success (cf. S. 1. 6. 46). Ηο here adopts the very words in which
they had sneered at him in order to make the glory which he was destined to
attain greater, by contrast with the position from which he had started. For
sanguis 01. 3. 27. 65 reyius sanyuis; C. S. 50 Anchisae Venerisque sanquis.
6. quem vocae, dilecte Maecenas. The old rendering ‘whom thou, 0
Maecenas, dost call Dear friend' may be dismissed, for dilecte Maecenas must
go together, 01. care M. 1. 20. 5 ; candide M. Epod. 14. 5. But the meaning
of quem vocas is obscure. (1) Orelli and Kiessling explain ‘ whom thou dost
summon,' i.e. to thy house, company, or the like, but this seems mean and
matter-of-fact 111 the middle 01 such a rhapsody. (2) Bucheler (accepted in
Orelli 4) gives quem vocas, ui e90 audiam, ducam, quoniam cliens tuus sum . . .
qui in clientela tua sum idemque in amicitiam tuam receptus. (3) May not
vocas have a much wider and larger sense, =‘ dost summon,' i.e. to poetic
endeavour, to the hope of immortality ’ἐ So taken it gives excellent sense, and
the behaviour of Maecenas is forcibly contrasted with that of Horace’s detractors
-‘I, whom many sneer at as lowborn, yes I, whom thy voice (vom, voco) on
the contrary, Maecenas, ever urges forward, shall never die' z so Wrangham
(v. Translations of Horace, selected by C. W. F. Cooper): ‘Not I, from
humble lineage sprung, Ι Not Ι, (1031· Patron, whom thy tongue Ι Summons
to fame, will fear to die Ι Or bound by Styx's fetters lie.' (4) If Pliiss be
right in his opim‘on as to the Ode, then vocas is used 01 ‘ calling on ’ Horace
by name at the funeral pyre and bidding him ‘hail and farewell ’ ε 01. Cat.
101. 10 frater, ave atque vaZe; Virg. Aen. 11. 97. ’7. obibo: 2. 17. 3 11.

9. iam iam . . . He speaks as though he felt his metamorphosis already
beginning. residunt cruribus, ‘ settle down on my ankles.' sido and its
compounds (as distinguished from sedeo) express a slow and yradual process 01
coming into 3 position of rest. 11. leves. Notice the quantity. 13.
Daedaleo notior.¹ So the best MSS. Orelli's old reading ocior involved a
hiatus without parallel in Horace3 and why should he wish to fly ‘ more
swiftly ' than IcarUS, though he may wish his flight to be ‘more famous ’ ’.ἰ 01
course Icarus (see Class. Dict.) is an unfortunate type of soaring humanity 101·
Horace to select, but in considering passages of this nature a too strict
examination 01 311 allusions is only foolish: the writer merely accumulates
sonorous and somewhat vague proper nameS, and trusts that they will have
much the same effect on the reader that an old lady once confessed to having
experienced from ‘that blessed word Mesopotamia ' in an otherwise 1111111- ,
telligible sermon. Bentley’s conjecture tutior is excellent but improbable.

' 15. canorus ales, ie. *a swan. Cf. 4. 3. 19 o mutis quoque piscibus Ι dona-
tura cycni, si libeat, sonum. So Pindar is called Dircaeum cycnum 4. 2. 25,
where Kiessling refers to a wild swan ( 2 cycnus musicus of naturalists) which in
winter visits Greece from the N. and in its ssight utters two trumpet-like notes.
It was sacred to Apollo, and in Alexandrine writers is the symbol 01 poets.
