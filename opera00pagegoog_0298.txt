270 HORACE BOOK 11

ODE XVII

‘ Why, Maecenas, clo you take the life out os me by your melancholy fore-
bodinys 2 Y ou are the prop of my fortunes, the very half os my beiny ; when
you die I shall die too ,⁴ I have sworn it and will keep my oath. I will never
quit your side, even on that last dread journey, no not even if all tlte monsters
of hell endeavour to prevent me. Such is the decree of Fate, for whatever the
constellation that yoverns your career, Libra, tlte Scorpion, or Capricornus, at
‘any rate it is wonderfully in accord with mine: remember how you have been
snatched from death itselJ, while I have had a similar miraculous escape ; let
us then be thanlclel, and each duly offer such thanlc-offerinys as befit our position!

Maecenas was a great invalid but passionately attached to life. Pliny,
H. N. 7. 51, speaks of him as suffering from a perpetua febris, and for the
last three years of his life never enjoying a moment’s natural sleep. He died
in Β.0. 8, Horace surviving him but a few days.

2. amicum est, ‘is it pleasing.’ 3. obire, sc. diem supremum, ‘ 10
die! 4. grande decus columenque rerum. Cf. 1. 1. 2 Maecenas . . .
0 et praesidium et dulce decus meum. For the metaphor in columen cf. Eur. ’
Iph. T. 57 στῦλοι ’γὰρ οἴκων εἰσὶ παῖδες ἄρσενες; Gal. ii. 9 Ἰάκωβος καὶ
Κηφᾶς καὶ Ἰωάννης οἱ δοκοῦντες στῦλοι εἶναι, ‘who seemed 10 110 Billa&= ’;
Tennyson, In Mem. c. 63 ‘the pillar of a people’s hope.' 5. partem:
supply alteram from altera in the next line: ‘ one of two parts,' i.e. ‘ the half’ ;
cf. 1. 3. 8. 7. 11Θο superstes integer, ‘ nor remaining a complete whole.’
Without Maecenas he would be 11111 0 part, a fraction of himself. Cf. our use
of ‘ an integer,’ and-2. 4. 22 n. 8. utramque ducet ruinam, ‘ shall
bring (with it) destruction to us both! ducet seems used in its simple sense, .
and Virgil’s trahit ruinam (Aen. 2. 465, quoted by Orelli), used of one portion
of a wall falling and dragging after it the rest, is not analcgous.

10. dixi sacramentum : a technical phrase for taking 1110 military oath
of obedience ; see Dict. of Ant. ibimus, ibimus: ‘ Horace speaks in the
plural, keeping up the idea of soldiers swearing to their general.’——Wickham.
The explanation is tempting, but cannot be right, for the plural is used
because Horace is speaking of himself and Maecenas. ‘ We will go, whenever
you shall lead the way, ready to take the last journey together.' For the

repetition of ibimus cf. 2. 14. ’1 11. 11. supremum iter=rdw νεάταν ὁδόν,
Soph. Ant. 807. 13. Chimaerae: cf. 1. 27. 23 11. Virgil places it with
other monsters at the entrance of the under world. igneae: cf. Hes.

Theog. 319 ’ὴ δὲ χίμαιραν ἔτικτε πνέουσαν ἀμαιμάκετον πῦρ, and. 4.2. 16.

14. si resurgat. Not should he rise up againss i. 0. from 1110 grave, as
Horace 1s speaking of himself as forcing his way at Maecenas' side through
the portals of death. It must therefore mean ‘should 110 rise to confront me'

17. seu Libra seu me . . .: see Dict. of Ant. S. v. Astroloyia. It was
a common belief that some particular planet was in the ascendant at the hour
of a person's birth (pars violentior n. h.: cf. Ep. 2. 2. 187 n.)‚ and exer-
cised a malignant or beneficent influence over him. Horace was not a believer
in Astrology (cf. 1. 11), and here implies that 'he knows and cares little
about it 3 ‘ whatever the character of your horoscope,' he says, ‘ or of mine, I
neither know nor care3 one thing only do I know, viz„ that they are both
