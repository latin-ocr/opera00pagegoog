128. pueri, ‘ my sons.' We cannot look upon Ofellus now as possessing
a number of slaves, ditis examen domus ,· so the pueri are the nati, line 115.

dressed; cf. Dan. i. 15 ‘fairer and fatter in flesh ' of Daniel and his fellow· ·

‘as lord of the soil to hold it as his own.' propriae, a tertiary predicate, is
much better than the weakly-supported proprie. Lucil. 478 proprium nil

postremum, ‘ at last 'z supposing neither want of thrift, nor ignorance of

that postremum (which Kiessling makes masc. ‘ when at his last hour ’) can be
an adverb. 133. nunc ager: Anthol. Pal. 9. 74. 13 3. pp. 238, ,410

SATIRE III
All save the Sapiens are Mad. ABOUT 33 ΒΩ.

DAMASIPPUS (line 16 11. ), who had lost all 1113 property through dealing 111
antiques, and had been converted, when 011 1116 point of committing suicide,
to the Stoic view that the above text is true, by the sage Stertinius, repeats
to Horace the discourse of Stertinius on that text: Madness is folly and
ignorance of truth, 43. There are many kinds of madness—there is the
raving lunatio, 53-623 but Damasippus, who wastes his all 011 curiosities,
and the creditor, who rashly trusts him, are mad, too, 64-76. Ambition‚
avarice, luxury, superstition, are all phases of madness, 78-80 3 in fact, all
but the Sapiens are mad, 81; 10111 especially the man of avarice, 82-98.
Staberius thought so much of riches that he forced his heirs to inscribe the
amount of their inheritance on his tombstone. It is difficult to say whether
he or Aristippus, who made his slaves throw away their burden of gold, was
more insane, 102-105. The miser who hoards his wealth, never to use it, is
insane, 105-128 ; he often goes mad worse than OresteS, poisoning his relatives
for their money, 131-141. Opimius the miser was mad, who would rather
die of starvation than pay for what would keep him alive. The two most
common types of madness are avarice and its opposite, prodigality, as exempli-
fied in Aulus and Tiberius Oppidius, 168-17 5. Ambition‚ too, is another
kind of madneSS, 179-186. Agamemnon, who slew his daughter from a con-
fusion of the ideas of right and wrong, was as mad as mad AJ‘ax, who slew
sheep, taking them sor men, 187-223. 'Phe prodigal is next exposed ε Nomen-
tanus, who gave away his property wholesale ; young Aesopus, who dissolved
and drank a pearl ; the young Arrii, who lunched on nightingales, were all
mad, 225-246. The infatuated lover is as mad. as a grown man playing
hobby·horse and other children's games, 247-272. Love is bad enough when
it only makes men silly3 though the lover who seeks for an omen of his
sweetheart’s affection by shooting epple-pips at the ceiling, and the old dotard
