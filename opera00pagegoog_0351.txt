may be felt.' 31. mortalis . . . ‘if moi-tal man struggles beyond (i.e.
to see beyond) what heaven allows.' ‘nmo-talis is emphatic ; cf. the indignant
nil mortalibus ardui est 1. 3. 37. Energy, vigour, push are all, according to
the philosophy of Horace, only folly in those whose life is but a span long3
the question he ceaselessly repeats is quid brevifortes iaculamur aevo multa 2
(2. 16. 17) ; 110 breathes the spirit of Ecclesiastes, but with him the ‘ conclusion
of the whole matter’ is not ‘Fear God ’ but ‘Rejoice in thy youth.' 32.
trepidat, which is used (2. 3. 12) of the movement of water down a steep
and stony bed, expresses restless, nervous eagerness, cf. 2. 11. 4 11.

33. componere, ‘arrange‚' ⁶ make the best of ’ ; τὸ παρὸν εὖ θέσθαι.
cetera ε opposed to quod adest .· both phrases are purposely wide and indefinite,
there is a contrast not only between the ‘ present ' and the ⁶ future,’ but between
things over which we have some control, and things which are wholly beyond
our control. 34. feruntur, ‘ are swept along.’ nuno . . . nunc, ‘ at
one time . . . at another-‚¹ medio aequore seems to refer to the level
surface (aequor, cf. aequus) of the stream as it is seen flowing between (medium)
its banks. Most MSS. give alveo (the opposite of vayus labitur ripa 1. 2. 18)
but this reading hardly accounts for the existence of the difficult aequore.
35. Etruscum: the final syllable cuts off before in in the next line, see
N otes on MetreS‚ p. xviii. ἓ 2. The license here is however exceptional, the
line, by its slow movement and unusual length, being intended to express the slow
monotonous movement of the stream. 38. volventis: parallel to dela-
bentis, ‘ rolling down along with it (una).’ Orelli takes una: inter se permixta.
39. clamore, ‘ech0.' diluvies (dis-law, ‘to wash away ²), ‘a deluge.'

41. potens sui . . . ‘lord of himself,' αὐτάρκης, not the slave of cir-
cumstance. Byron gives a different force to the same phrase when he says
‘ Lord of himself—that heritage of woe.’ For the gen. cf. 1. 6. 10 n. 42.
deget, sc. tempus, ‘will pass his time.' cui licet . . . ‘who can at
each day's close say “I have lived ’' ⁴(i.e. to-day): to-morrow let . . . '
vivere is frequently used of enjoyiny or usiny life, and not merely existing3
cf. Fr. viveurs and Mart. 1. 15. 11 ‘non est, crede mihi, sapientis dicere
‘ vivam ' .· Ι sera nimis vita est crastina .· vive hodie. 45. non tamen
. . . ‘yet he shall not render void whatever is behind us, nor re-shape and
make undone that which the hurrying hour has once carried away.² The
same curious reflection on the limits even of Omnipotence is found elsewhere,
ay. Agathon (quoted Ar. Eth. 6. 2, 6) μόνου ’γὰρ αὐτοῦ καὶ θεὸς στερίσκεται,
Ι ἀγένητα ποιεῖν ἅσσ’ ἂν ᾗ πεπραγμένα.

49. Fortuna . . . ε admirably paraphrased by Dryden :—

‘ Fortune that with malicious j0y I can enj0y her while she's kind ;

Does man, her slave, oppress, But when she dances in the wind,
Proud of her office to destroy, And shakes her wings and will not stay,
Is seldom pleased to bless 3 I puff the fickle J'ade away :
Still various and unconstant still, The little or the much she gave is
But with an inclination to be ill, quietly resign'd,
Promotes, degradeS, delights in strife, Content with poverty my soul I arm,
And makes a lottery of life. And virtue, though in ragS, will keep
me warm.'

54. resigno, ⁵1 unseaL' ‘canceL' Fortune has given her sealed hond,
Horace breaks the seal and gives back the bond. 55. virtute me involvo t
Plat. Rep. 5. 457 A ἀρετὴν ἀντὶ ἱματίων ἀμφιέσονται. 56. Sine dote.
Poverty will be the honesta uxor instead of the J'ade Fortune. 57. mugiat,
