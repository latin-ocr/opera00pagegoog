than English, bona being commonly used 101· property, possessions. For gen.
after pauperrimus, cf. od. 3. 6. 17 11.

80. at Si 2 the reply of the ammas, who urges that in case of illness riches
procure attention. temptare, often of diseases ; cf. 2. 3. 163. 81. lecto
te adfixit, ‘has fastened you to your bed.’ adflixit, ‘dashed down,' has
much better MS. authority here, and Mr. L. Purser quotes Tennysou’s de-
scription of Edith's illness in Aylmer's Field, how a low sever found the girl
‘and flung her down upon a conch of fire' ; but the words are often inter-
changed in MSS. (0.9. 2. 2. 79) and Tennyson may have had this passage with
adfliaeit in his mind when he wrote his verse. 82. adsideat, ‘ sit by your
bedside.’ Cf. Ov. Her. 20. 137 adsidet aemam Tac. Agr. 45„ fomenta
(foveo), ‘ fomentations.'

84. Horace replies that the miser's death is wished for by all his relations,
neighbours, acquaintances (noti), even the children in the streets. 86. post
omnia ponas, a harsh tmesis here 101 postponas omnia. Cf. Cic. Off. 3. 17.
71 meda bonis ponit ante. 88-91. at 31 cog-natos . . . frenis, ‘but
even if you were to try to retain the affections of the relatives whom nature
has given you with no trouble on your part, you would be wasting your
labour (the effort would be too much aquai-nst the yrain) ; you might 33 well
try to teach an ass to gallop.' Others say that nullo labore belongs to
retinere and servare, not to dat. ‘ If you were to wish, with no effort of your
own, to preserve the affections of your relatives.' This idea was refuted by
Bentley, who pointed out that, apart from the entangled order, operam perdas
is inconsistent with it 3 for a man 0311 hardly waste his labour 11 110 expends
none. Very good MSS. give an si, which Bentley explains : An potius nihili
sacis a cognatis amari, et omne quod ad demerendo-s* eos inpendi debet, male
locatum et perditum iri putas? quasi si asinum traderes mayistro, etc. ; ‘ or
would you count it a throwing away of your 1abour, 11 you were to try to
retain the affections of your relatives, as though it were a thing not worth
having 2 ' So too nearly Ritter: ‘ or would you be wasting your labour‚ if you
were to try,’ etc. (No ε it would be an easy matter, if you would but try it.)

92. denique, ‘in short‚’ ‘to sum up.' cumque, ‘and now that you
have got more (than you used to have), fear poverty less (than you used to).’
94. ne facias: so 33 not to behave like Ummidius, i.e. live in constant sear
of starvation3 or, perhaps better, meet the same fate as Ummidius, facere
being 3 neutral verb; cf. 64 n. 95. qui tam: Bentley's emendation for
quidam. Horace never uses quidam with proper names, and is not likely to
have spoken of a man, who was so 11011 33 to measure his money, as a nobody.
By reading qui tam an asyndeton is avoided, and tam is supplied before dives,
as in line 20. Horace several times, it is true, uses an adjective or adverb
followed by ut without tam, as 1. 5. 33 ; 7. 13; but here it is not so much
the omission of tam as the omission of qui that is the chief difficulty.

96. metiretur z· measure out in vessels, modii, for instance, instead of
counting it, nuwwrare. The expression is proverbial. Xen. Hell. 3. 2. 27

ἀργύριον. 9Ἷ. ad usque. So 1. 5. 963 Virg. Aen. 11. 262. 99.
opprimeret, ⁴ surprisa' ‘come suddenly on.’ liberta: Horace probably
refers to some well-known case of 3 freedwoman killing her miser master with
311 axe, 33 Clytaemnestra killed Agamemnon φονίῳ πελέκει, Soph. El. 99.
