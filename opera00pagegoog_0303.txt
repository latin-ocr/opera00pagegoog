21. tu cum . . . For the battle of the Giants see 3. 4. 49 seq„ and 01888.
Dict. s. v. Gigantes parentis regna, ‘the realms of the· great Father,‘ i.e.
heaven the abode of Jupiter. per arduum, ‘through the steep sky ' ε Virgil
G. 1. 281 describes how they attempted this by piling mountains upon one
another, Horace purposely uses a vague phrase. 23. Rhoetum: one of
the giantS. leonis, because Bacchus assumed this form during the sray ; he
had also assumed it when taken prisoner by Tyrrhenian pirates.

25. quamquam. .The construction is quamquam, choreis et iocis ludo-
qne aptior dictus, puynae non sat idoneus ferebaris. 26. non sat idoneus,
‘not sufficiently well suitedss i. e. ‘very ill- suited,’ cf. non leni line 15. 27.
sed idem, ‘but yet'; for idem used where opposite qualities are represented
as existing in the same individua1‚see 2.10. 16 11. 28. pacis eras
mediusque bem, ‘thou djdst take thy part in peace and war alike' ,ι
Dionysus notwithstanding what was said of him showed that though he
enJ’oyed peace he was ready for war. On the position of que here
and line 32, Orelli well remarks that the phrase, if expressed fully, would
be pacis eras ‘medius mediusque belli, but that, one medius being omitted for
111-811151, the phrase 18 left as in the text. No doubt too convenience as regards
scansion has a great influence in poetry on the position which que is allowed
to assume. cf. 1. 30. 6 Gratiae properentque Nymphae, 3. 4. 11 ludo satiya-
tumque somrw, C. S. 22 cantus referatque ludos. For vc in a similar position
cf. 2. 7. 25. The idiom is naturally very common in elegiacs, e.g. patriam
destituuntque domum. 29. aureo cornu decorum. The horn is a very
ancient symbol of strength, vigour, plenty and fertility. Hence the god of
wine ‘that strengthens man’s heart ' is represented with horns (see Sandys,
Bacchae 920- -2). ovid, A. A. 1. 239, says that under the influenee of wine
pauper cornua swmiae cf. too3. 21. 18 tu (18 wine). ,addis cornua paupere
and also for the use of the word‘ horn’ 1 Samuel ii. Η1 my horn 18 exalted 111
the Lord.' Orelli and Kiessling refer to the ‘golden drinking· horn’ with
which, they say, the god 1s often depicted as ‘'adorned. 31. recedentis:
with pedes and crura=‘ of you retreating‚’ ‘ as you retreated.’ The god had
gone to Hades to bring back his mother Semele. trilingui ore ought
to mean ⁶ a mouth with three tongues,' but: ‘the tongue of each of his three
mouths.’

ODE XX

‘ I, Maecenas, shall never die but shall be chanyed into a swan whose song]
shall be heard throuyhout the world .· therefore zet none mourn over my cenotaph!

The Ode is conventional and unnatural: Book 3 8180 concludes with an
Ode which expresses the hope of an immortality of fame, but which affords an
admirable contrast to this in force and power. The Ode 18 811 amplification of
Ennius’ Epitaph on himself, nemo me lammis decoret, nec funera fletu Ι faxit.
cur? volito vim per ora virum, but the epitaph and the Ode show vividly
the distinction between what is genuine and what is fantastic in poetry.
Ρ11188 takes this to be the situation. the poet 18 (188(1; his corpse is on the
funeral pyre3 Maecenas calls upon his friend (cf. quem vocas line 6) for the last
time: in answer the poet' s ghost or shade proclaims its transformation‚ etc. “

1. non usitata. . . ‘on no ordinary or faltering pinions will I sweep, a
bard of double shape‚ through the bright upper air.’ non usitata: partly
meaning that lyric poetry had not been attempted in Latin by any before him,
partly that the quality of his poetry was of no common stamp3 ef. 3. 1. 2
