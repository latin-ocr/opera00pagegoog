458 HORAOE Book 11

303. All MS. authority of weight is for abscisum here, from abscido, which
means to cui off ; but the sense decidedly favours abscissum, from abscindo,
which means to rend off, for Agave and the other Bacchae tore Pentheus in
pieces with their hands, Eur. Bacch. 1125 seq. manibus : Euripides again
and again mentions the fact of Agave carrying in her own hands the head of
her son, as the striking point of horror; aq. Bacch. 1139 κρᾶτα δ’ ἄθλιον Ι
ὅπερ λαβοῦσα τυγχάνει μήτηρ χεροῖν Ι πήξασ’ ἐπ’ ἄκρον θύρσον. 305. Veris t
‘the truth ' : cf. line 223 cruentis.

308. aedificas τ Horace was probably building on his Sabine farm, which
he had received from Maecenas about a year before this timet Damasippus
hints that he was exceeding his means and station in doing so, Dama-
sippus tells him that is much the same thing as if he were to ape tall
men (longos), when he himself was puny in stature. longus, of a tall
man, occurs Catull. 67. 47 Zonyns homo esi. 309. bipedalis, ‘ you are
like a dwarf two feet high aping tall men': Horace was, according to
his own account, corporis emiqni Ep. 1. 20. 24 3 and for his figure
see Intr. p. x, 310. corpore maiorem, ‘too big for his body ' 3 cf. Ov.
Her. 12. 184 nnnc animis audi verba minora meis· Turbo was a plucky
gladiator of small stature, like Tydeus, who μικρὸς μὲν ἔην δέμας ἀλλὰ μαχή-
της. 311. spiritum et incessum, ‘ the fire and strut.’ 312. verum,
proper, reasonable, Just: sc. facere; cf. Ep. 1. 7. 98. 313. tantum dis-
similem: the reading of vei. Bland„ much better than tanto of many MSS.
for this abl. of difference is only used with comparatives. On the other hand,
for tantum cf. 2. 5. 92 mulium similis ,· Ep. 1. 10. 3 mulium dissimiles. The
construction is ie quoqne verum est (facere) tantum dissimilem, ei certare (cnm
illo) tantum minorem, i.e. cum tanto minor sis. Maecenas' magnificent
mansion on the Esquiline is especially referred to 1. 8. 7.

314. The well-known Aesopian fable of the frog and the ox—here a calf.
pullis : the young of any animal (akin to puer). 316. eliserit, regularly
used of squeezing, crushing to death. 317. quantana? ne is superfluous ;
cf. 2. 2. 107 n. tantum magna, like tantum dissimilem line 313=tam
mayna=iania. Cf. Babr. 28. 6 ἡ δὲ φρῦνος ἠρώτα Ι φυσῶσ’ ἑαυτήν, εἰ τοσοῦ-
τον ἢν ὄγκῳ Ι τὸ ζῶον, Phaedr. 1. 24. 318. maior dimidio, ‘bigger by
half ἐ an absurd answer for the young frog to give, as the calf must have
appeared to it 1000 times bigger than its mother. To avoid this, many take
maior dimidio of the old frogzmaior facia dimidio, ‘when grown half as large
again she asked “ was he that big ἓ ” ’ Horace puts, however, maior dimidio into
the mouth of the young frog, with the intention of producing a ridiculous effect.
num tantum: sc. magna. MSS. give tanto. Notice num, ‘ surely not 2’

320. abludit: ἅπαξ εἰρημένονεαόἠοττεί, ἀπᾴδει, ‘does not much dis-
agree.' 321. oleum adde camino, ‘throw oil on the furnace‚' a pro-
verbial expression, cf. Lucian, Tim. 44 πίττῃ καὶ ἐλαίῳ (πῦρ) κατασβεννύναι.
From caminus comes chimney‚ through cheminee. 322. ei quis sanus
fecit: cf. 2. 7. 117 aui insanit homo aut versus facii,· A. P. 296 excludit
sanos Helicone poetas Democritus, Poetry is a divine madness, and the poet
must be in a ‘ fine frenzy ' 3 cf. Cic. de Div. 1. 37. 80 neqai sine furore Demo-

tween μάντις and μανία. 323. horrendam rabiem : this is the strongest
expression which Horace uses to describe his passionate temper, of which he
