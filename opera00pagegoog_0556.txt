528 HORACE BOOK ‘1

doleo is to feel it: cf. Cic, ad Att. 12. 28. 2 maerorem minui, dolorem nec
potui, nec, si possem, vellem. 8. insolabiliter, a ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. About
eighty of these have been noted in the works of Horace. istuc, ‘where
you are now,' i.e. to the woods and fields. mens animusque=vofis καὶ
Hunos: mens meliora intelleyii, animus adesse cupii, Ritter ; ‘ my judgment
and my heart.' 9. fert, ‘ would fain hurry me.’ amat, ‘ would gladly ' :
cf. Od. 3. 9. 24 tecum vivere amem. spatiis: cf. l. 7. 42. claustra:
the bars in front of the carceres or -stalls, in which the chariots and horses
were posted, kept them from the course, until the signal was given. 10.
rure: cf. 1. 7. 1 11. z ‘you praise the townsman’S‚ Ι the rustic’s state ⁹—Con.

11-1'7. Thesault is notin the place. You are fickle, but I am consistent.
11. nimirum, ‘ of course‚’ carries with it no irony here: cf. l. 9. 1 11. 12.
stultus, ‘in his folly.’ uterque : although Horace passed in line 11 from
the case of his bailiff and himself to a general reflexion, he still has in his
mind the position of two men wishino to exchange stations. We may· retain
the indefiniteness of ‘ either’ in translation. ffimeritum ‘innocent ' z Od. 1.
17. 28 inmeritam . . . vestem; S. 2. 3. 7 inmeritus . . . paries. 13. se
effugit: cf. Od. 2. 16. 20. 14. mediastinus, ‘drudge‚’ one who was
placed in medio, at every one’s beck and call. The Scholiasts suppose some
connexion with ἄστυ, and 1111111 1110 use to town-slaves ; but the word may be
used of any kind of drudge: cf. Columella 1. 9. 3 mediastinus qualiscumque
status potestesse, dummodo perpetiendo labori sii idoneus. astu was not indeed
unknown to archaic Latin ε but more probably the word was formed after the
analogy of clandestinus. tacita prece: cf. 1. 16. 60 ; Pers. 5. 184 labra
moves tacitus.

καί 18-30. You care oniyfor the Zow sensual pleasures of the town ,· ancl hate
hard work. 18. miramur: cf. 1. 6. 9. disconvenit: cf. l. 1. 99.
19. tesqua, ‘wilds.' The Scholiasts call this a Sabine word; it seems to
have no extant cognates‚ except perhaps in the Sanskrit tuk'lc'ha (phonetically
equivalent to miska), ‘empty.' Lucan, Phars. 6. 41 has salius nemorosaque
tesca .· otherwise the word is found only in archaic writers. 20. amoena:
1. 16. 15. 21. fornix, ‘brothel‚' originally an arched vault ; Juv. 3. 156 ;
ll. 171. uncta, ‘greasy.’ Orelli prefers the explanation of the Comm.
Cruq. nidore redolens et optimis cibis plena, because Horace elsewhere uses
the word in the sense of ‘luxurious ' or ‘rich': 1. 15. 44 3 17. 12. But here
some contempt is evidently implied: cf. S. 2. 4. 62 quaecumque inmundis
fervent allata popinis. The popina ‘ cgfflnshnp ’ was a place of low resort:
the form of the word points probably to a Campanian origin ; it would regu-
larly correspond in Oscan to a Latin coquina, only found in late writers.
st. incutiunt, ‘ inspire’ ; more commonly with metum, timorem, and the
like: but cf. Lucr. 1. 19 omnibus incutiens blandum per pectora amorem.
23. angulus iste: a contemptuous term used by the cibatus, as we might
say ‘hole and corner.' Pepper and frankincense of course did not grow in
Italy atme nowhere speaks of wine as produced 011 his own estate
(cf. 1. 16 ; Od. 2. 18. 14): the vile Sabinum of od. 1. 20. 1 may have been
bought in the dolium and only bottled by Horace. uffa-{quam uvam.

24. taberna : the villa of Horace was some three or four miles from the
nearest high read, which might be expected to be supplied with tabernae
diversoriae ,· cf. Varro de R. R. 1. 2. 23 si aqer secundum viam ei opportunus
viatoribus loeus, aedificandae tabernae diversoriae, quae suni . . . fructuosae.
26. strepitum, ‘ strains' 3 not contemptuously= ‘ din‚' as Orelli takes it:
