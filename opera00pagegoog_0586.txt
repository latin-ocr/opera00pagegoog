558 HORACE 110οΚ 11

118 is ranked. 45. caudae pilos: it is possible that there is a reference
here to the story told by Plutarch (Sert. 16) of how Sertorius taught his troops
the value of quiet perseverance instead of violence by setting a strong man to
pull fiercely at the tail of a feeble horse, and a weak man to pull out the hairs
one by one from the tail of a powerful steed. But as Horace is not teaching
a moral lesson here, but simply illustrating a logical process, there seems very
little reason to suppose that this story was in his mind at all. The hairs in a
tail may very well have been a current example in the schools‚ like the grains in
a heap. The fallacy of the φαλακρός (the number of hairs which make a man
⁴ bald ²) invented by the eristic Eubulides is a somewhat similar instance.
46. etiam is supported by the maJ‘ority of good MSS„ and confirmed by the
imitation in Pers, 6. 58 adde etiam uniam, unum etiam .· it means ⁴ still‚' as in
its common use with comparativeS. Some good MSS. read ct item ,· cf. Ter.
Andr. 1. 1. 49 sed postquam amans accessit, pretium pollicem, unias etitem alter.
47. cadat elusus, ‘foiled and overthrown,’ a metaphor from a gladiator.
ruentis acervi, ‘the diminishing heap‚' in Greek σωρός, whence σωρείτης,
acervatis aryumentatiO, cf. Cic. de Div. 2. 4. 11. The nature of it is explained
by Cic. Acad. 2. 16. 49 captiosissimo acuere interroyatiooiis utuntur, quod glenus
minime in philosophia probari solet, cum aliquid minutatim et gradatim addi-
ίαν aut demitur. Soritas hoc vocant, quia acervum efficiavit uno addito gro-ano.
48. redit in fasma, ‘ goes back upon the annaIS.’ 49. Libitina: an
ancient Italian goddess, originally of gardens and of pleasure generally,
called also Lubentina (from lubet, lubido, etc.) Afterwards she came to be
regarded as the goddess of burial, by a transition strange to us, but not un-
exampled in Italy, where the Sabine Feronia is compared both with Flora and
with Persephone, and in Greece where Aphrodite sometimes is represented as
Persephone. Servius Tullius is said to have ordained that in every case of
death a piece of money should be contributed to her chest3 and biers and
other necessaries for funerals were kept in her grove (lucus Libitinae) on the
Esquiline, and let out on hire. Here too the undertakers (Libitinarii) had
their quarters. Of. Od. 3. 30. 63 S. 2. 6. 19 ; Mart. 10. 973 Liv. 40. 19. 3
pestilentia . . . tanta erat, ut Libitina ad funera vix sufficeret.

50-54. There is a conventional style of Zaudatiooi of owr older poets noio
current, which secures them qenai-al approval. 50. Ennius is called fortis
mainly because of the brave spirit in which he sung of the battles of Rome.
At the same time he served with distinction among the Messapian allies of
Rome in the second Punic War. Prof. Sellar in his admirable study of Ennius
says ε ‘ This actual service in a great war left its impress on the work done by
Ennius. Fragments both of his tragedies and his Annals prove how thoroughly
he understood and appreciated the best qualities of the soldierly character.
This fellowship in hardship and danger fitted him to become the national poet
of a race of soldiers' (Roman PoetS, 67). But to compare him with Homer is
to put him to a test which he cannot be expected to stand: ib. 102. 51.
leviter curarezsccurus esse Porph. : Ennius is now sure of his harvest of
fame, about which he had previously been anxious, and so cares little for the
promises of his Pythagorean dreamS. Horace is here setting forth the high
reputation which the older poets were enjoying in his own day, not criticising
them fr0m his own point of view, and censuring Ennius for carelessneSS, as
some editors have wrongly supposed—Bergk has shown that Horace probably
takes Varro as his type of the critici, several of the judgments here passed
closely agreeing with those of Varro in various workS. 52. quo cadant,
‘what becomes of.' somnia P. : Ennius indulged in the ‘ Pythagorean
