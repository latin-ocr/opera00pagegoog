remanent, neque aliter eliduntur. Baiae is represented as bearing a grudge
against invalids who have courage to follow Musa's severe regime. 8.
caput: Celsus (1. 4; 4. 5) recommends the douche for strengthening the
head and stomach. 9. Clusinis: we do not know of any baths at Clusium,
but at S. Casciano de Bagni, about twelve miles to the south, there are baths
of ancient date, and it has been suggested (Dennis, Cities of Etruria, 2. 291)
that Horace may have been referring to these. But perhaps his language
does not require anything more than the ordinary springS‚ not wanting in the
hilly country round Clusium itself. Gabios: cf. 1. 11. 7; Strabo 5. 3 ἐν δὲ
τῷ πεδίῳ τούτῳ ὁ Ἀνίων διέξεισι καὶ τὰ Ἀλβουλα καλούμενα. ῥεῖ ὕδατα ψυχρὰ
ἐκ πολλῶν πηγῶν, πρὸς ποικίλας νόσους καὶ πίνουσι καὶ ἐγκαθημένοις ὑγιεινά.

10. nota: sc. equo. The horse wanted to turn down to the right, as usual,
where the road branched off, and led through Cumae to Baiae. This was
apparently at Capua: the via Domitiana, which led straight from Sinuessa
to Cumae along the coast, was made by the Emperor Domitian (Stat. Silv. 4.
3). 12. stomachosus habena, ‘pulling angrily at the rein ²: habena
is abl. of instrument3 ‘venting his anger with.' 13. sed, i.e. but it is
no good sayinq anything, for, etc. equis: Bentley, regarding this
clause as a general reflexion, substituted the plur. for equi of most MSS.
14. populum, not an uncommon expression for the inhabitants of a muni-
cipium: cf. Wilmanns‚ Ex. Inscr. Lat. 1194, 1804, 1809, etc„ where we
have S. P. Q. T. of Tibur. 15. collectos . . . imbres, i.e. in tanks
(lacus). 16. iugis might seem redundant after perennes: hence some
read dulcis with vet. Bland. and a few other MSS. But dulcis is here
out of place: rain-water is not less dulcis, i.e. not more salt or bitter‚ than
spring-water. iuyis may be used either of the water (Cic. de Div. 2. 13. 31
aquae iugis colore; S. 2. 6. 2) or of the spring (de Div. 1. 50. 112 haustam
aquam de iuyi puteo ,· de N. D. 2. 9. 25 ew puteis iugyibus aquam calidam
trahi). nihil moror, ‘I don't care about ⁷ : cf. Plaut. Trin. 2. 2. 21 nil eqo
istos moror faeceos more-9. Horace knew that the wine was indifferent, and
was therefore prepared to take his own supply with him. The wine of Sur-
rentum, not far from Salernum, was a thin light wine, recommended to oon-
valeseents (Plin. H. N. 14. 8), called by Tiberius qenerosum acetum and by
Caligula nobilis vappa, though Persius speaks of it as lene (3. 93). Cf.
S. 2. 4. 55 11.

17. quidvis, ‘anything,’ not ‘any kind of wine‚' which would necessarily
have been quodvis 19. cum spe divite . . .: ef. 1. 5. 17. 21.
Lucanae shows that Horace is now thinking of Velia, not of Salernum.
iuvenem, i.e. as though I were young again. 22. apros: Lucanian boars
are mentioned in S. 2. 3. 234 ; 8. 6. educet, ‘rearS,' cf. Ov. Pont. 1. 10. 9
quod mare, quod tellus, adpone, quod educat aer. 23. schinne, ‘sea-
urchins': cf. S. 2. 4. 33 Miseno oriuntur echini ,· Juv. 4. 143 semel aspecti
litus dicebat echini .· Plin. Ep. 1. 15. 3 mentions ostrea, mdvas, echinos as the
dainties at a banquet. Athenaeus 3. 41 says ‘echini if eaten with vinegar and
honey, parsley and mint, are sweet and easy of digestion.' 24. Phaeax‚
i.e. like one of the courtiers of Alcinous : cf. 1. 2. 28.

25-46. Maenius os old liked to yet tlte daintiestfare he could, by the exer-
cise os his ivit ,· lmt if at any time his ¹qluttony was reduced to δαί-ἱείς] itself on
plain coarse foed, he was a merciless censurer of epicurea I am lilce kim, and
fully appreciate comfort when I can yet it. 26. Many MSS. begin a new
Epistle here, failing to notice the connexion between this sketch of Maenius
