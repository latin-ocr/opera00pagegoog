566 HORAOE BOOK 11

munditiae, ‘elegance.’ The verse and diction of Ennius though rough in
themselves, were polished as compared with the poetry of Livius and Naevius.
160. hodieque, ‘ and even yet,’ in the Fescennine verses and the Atellan plays.

161-176. The Romans were late in taking) to the drama: for trayedy they
liave sufficient elevation and passion, but baclo painstakinq finish. Their
comedy, which th ey think easier, thouyh. faiture here is more inexcusable, is
ruined by haste in productiori, due to yreed. 161. serus refers to ferus
victor, i.e. the Romans, and ‘late ' must mean ‘late in the history of the city.'
162. post Punica bella: the Third Punic War is not here included, as of
less importance than the other two. Aulus Gellius 17. 21. 45 quotes from
Porcius Licinus (flor. 100 Rc.) Poenico bello secundo Illusa pinnato yradu Ι
intulit se bellicosam in Romuli yentem feram. This is somewhat more accurate
than Horace, for ‘ even during the Second Punic War dramatic performances
went on uninterruptedly‚ inasmuch as most of Naevius' works and one half of
Plautus’ literary exertions (though perhaps the less fertile half) fall into the
time of this war' (Teuffel, Ro‘m. Lit. 1. 104). But perhaps it is better to
connect quietus closely with post Punica betta, ⁶ enjoying peace after the close
of the Punic wars.’ 163. Thespis, the traditional founder of the Attic
tragedy : cf. A. P. 276. Horace here neglects the chronological order, as in
S. 1. 4. 1 Eupolis atque Cratinus Aristophanesque poetae. Euripides could not
have been brought into 6 hexameter verse, at any rate in the nominative case.

164. temptavit rem, ‘ made the attempt 'z rem is not, as some editors
suppose, the object of vertere, attracted out of its place 3 the construction is
like that in Livy 1. 57. 2 temptata res est, si capi Ardea posset. ; 2. 35. 4
temptata res est, si disicere rem possent. vertere, ‘ translate,’ without an
obJ'ect expressed. 165. placuit sibi: Prof. Sellar admirably brings out
in his Roman Poets of the Republic, 5. 151, the reasons for the satisfaction
found by the Romans in the drama: ‘The popularity and power of Roman
tragedy, during the century preceding the downfall of the Republic, are to be
attributed chiefly to its didactic and oratorical force, to the Roman bearing of
the persons represented, to the ethical and occasionally the political cast
of the sentiments expressed by them, and to the plain and vigorous style in
which they are enunciated.’ 166. spirat tragicum satis, ⁴ has sufficient
tragic inspiration.’ feliciter audet refers apparently to the boldness of
the language, especially in Pacuvius and Accius. Cf. A. P. 56 seq. 167.
lituram: cf. S. 1. 10. 723 A. P. 292-43 Caecina in Cic. ad Fam. 6. 7. 1
mendum scripturae litura tollitur; and Pope's imitation: ‘ Even copious ·
Dryden wanted or forgot Ι The last and greatest art, the art to blot.’

’ 168. ex medic, ‘ from daily life.’ arcessit: vet. Bland. has accessit ,-
hut it is clearly better to take res as acc. plur. rather than nom. sing. ε the
perfect tense is out of place ; and if res is the subJect of arcessit, it must also
be taken as the subject of ereditur, instead of comoedia 3 but the latter gives
a much more satisfactory sense. 170. veniae, ‘indulgence': even un-
educated spectators 6611 see the absurdities of unnatural comedies. 171.
quo pacto, ‘in what a fashion.’ Is this blame or praise2 Editors are
divided in their judgment. Porph. has quam indecenter, inconyrue ‚· and so
Conington: ‘What ill-sustained affairs Ι Α16 his close fathers and his love-
sick heirs !’ Lambinus 011 the other hand argued that as Horace in A. P.
270 seq. blames his rough metre and coarse wit, there would be little lest, if he
did not allow him even the credit of vigorous character-painting: and Schutz
points out that in criticising Roman tragedy Horace first recognises merit,
