planted in the centre of the peristylium (see Dict. of Ant. s. v. domus), cf.
Ep. 1. 10. 22 nempe inter varias nutritur silva columnas ; but (1) such
luxury would only be possible in very large mansions, and (2) it is hard to
imagine that such a ‘grove' could be spoken of as ‘moaning again with the
wind' if indeed the wind got to it at all. On the other hand it is easy to
imagine that there were trees among and around the houses where Lyce lived ε
the question audis . . . ventis? might be put with accuracy on windy nights to
many Londoners who do not possess a peristyle. 7. et positas . . . ⁶ and (see
you) how Jupiter with unclouded divinity freezes the fallen snow. ' puro : frost
is keenest on clear nights. . For Iuppiter, ‘the god of the sky‚' cf. 1. 1. 25 n.

10. ne currente . . . ‘lest the wheel run back and the rope go with it.'
Τ110 metaphor is from a man hauling up a weight over a wheel or pulley : if
he attempts to raise a weight beyond his strength, it soon overpowers him,
the rope runs from his hands and the wheel revolves rapidly in a direction
opposite to its former one. The point is that if Lyce makes the lover’s task
too heavy he will ‘drop ' it, cf. lines 19, 20. currente retro rota: note
the sound. 11. Penelopen, ‘a Penelope’ or ‘to be a Penelope.' The
lines convey a taunt3 hinting that Lyce was of low birth and that fine airs
are out of place in one not born to be a fine lady. Cf. 2. 4. 13-20.

14. tinctus viola pallor, ‘ paleness of the violet's hue? viola is the
pale yellow violet, λευκόιον : cf. Virg. Ecl. 2. 47 paloentes violas, 15. vir
Pieria . . . ‘your husband smitten with a Pierian enchantress.’ paelex
(from pellicio) is always used with direct reference to the injured wife, cf.
Epod. 3. 13 3 5. 63. PieriazMacedonian. 16. supplicibus tuis parcas.
This is the main sentence. The connexion of thought between parcas and
what follows seems to be: ‘Pity us, for at present you are as hard as oak
and venomous as a viper, and that surely is not the character you would
wish to have? 19. hoc: deicticz‘this of mine’ ; cf. ὅδε ὁ ἀνήρ;“Ι.’

scribed himself as Zyiny (porrectum) at the door.

ODE XI

‘ I call upon thee, Meo-cury, and upon the tyre thou didst invent, by the aid
os which Amphion was enabled to move even stenes, to tecwh me a strain to
which the stony-hearted Isyde may tend her ears—Lyde who is now as timid
and shy as a youny nnbroken coZt. With thy aid howwer, Ο tyre, I may
move her, sor thou canet work wonder3‚ thou canet make the damned foryet sor
a while their torments : Tityos and Ixion emite, the Danaids rest from their
eeaseless tash. For Isyde's benefit let me recount that famous story,· Zet her
hear of the punishment that has overtaken the quilty women who slew their
husbands, and os the fame of Hypewnnestra whose splendid falsehood saved
her young husband’s life at the risle qs her own.'

From line 25 Lyde, the nominal subJect of the Ode, passes completely out
os sight as the poet becomes absorbed in his brilliant recital of the story of
the Danaids, for whom see Class. Dict. S. v. Aegyptus and Danaus.
