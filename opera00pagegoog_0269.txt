ODE I

⁶ Pollio, you are unitim] the history of tlte recent civil ware, quil therefore,
for a while, your other pur-saite, poetica& oralom'cal ancl military. The subject
is a slirrirzy one ,· I seem already lo be hearing] your vivia description—the
din and tumult of Pharsalia, Africa exultiny in the culpouriny of Roman
blood, the whole world witness to our fatal dissensions. Bul I mast break off,
the theme is too serious for my sportive muse?

G. Asinius Pollio (see the excellent account in Smith's Dict.) was like
Maecenas a liberal patron of literature, and the friend of both Virgil and
Horace (S. 1. 10. 85). Horace takes the opportunity of his commencing a
history of the civil wars to send him this complimentary Ode into which he
cleverly introduces (lines 9-16) allusions to Pollio's various distinctions.

1. ex Metello consule, ‘ from the consulship of Metellus.' Q. Caecilius
Metellus Celer was consul B.c. 60, the year in which Caesar, Pompey and
Crassus formed the first Triumvirate, and Pollio had selected that date for
commencing the history of that portion of the civil wars which ended in
the establishment of the Empire under Augustus. 2. belli caueae, ay.
the disaster which befel Crassus at Carrhae (13.0. 53), and the death of Julia
the daughter of Caesar and wife of. Pompeius, which broke the last link
between them (Rc. 54). vitia, ‘faults,' i.e. in carrying on the war.
modos, ‘ phaseS,' the various ways in which it was conducted. 3. ludum
Fortunae. Fortune makes ‘sport ' of human life (cf. 3. 29. 50 3 1. 2. 37 n.)‚
and had especially done so in the tragic death of all three triumvirs. graves
principum amicitias: the triumvirate. graves, ‘ruinouS,’ i.e. to Rome.

5. uncta cruoribus, ‘ stained with streams of blood‚' τῖε. at Pharsalia,
Thapsus Philippi. 6. periculosae plenum opus aleae: opus is in
apposition to the whole of the accusatives which have gone before, ⁶ a task full
of risk and danger.’ Why Pollio's task was so difficult the words el incedis

. . at once explain. 'Phe historian of disasters which were so recent is like
a man who after a conflagration incautiously advances among the debris the
surface of which alone has cooled. But though the expression incedis . . .
doloso is proverbial and qeneral (cf. Gallim. Ep. 46. 2 ἔστι πῦρ ὑπὸ τῇ
σποδιῇ ; Prop. 1. 5. 5 igmotos vestiyia serre per iynes) yet it would seem that
in using it Horace had also in mind one of the special phenomena of his native
land ; cf. Macaulay, Hist. Eng. c. 6: ‘When the historian of this troubled
reign (J ames Π.) turns to Ireland, his task becomes peculiarly difficult and
delicate. His steps—to borrow the fine image used on a similar occasion by
a Roman poet—are on the thira crusl of ashes hemath rohieh the lava is still
glomero? 7. tractas: present, ‘thou art taking in hand' ε Pollio's work
was only begun (cf. lines 9·11).

9. tragoediae. A Greek word for a Greek thing put in Latin
letterS. The Romans imported ‘tragedy ' from Greece where it was a native
growtb‚ and they also imported its name (τραγῳδία ‘the goat-song‚’
A. P. 220 n.) at the same time, as was also the case with ‘comedy' (κωμῳδία,
