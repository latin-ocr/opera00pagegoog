abl. abs. like intestato, auspicato, ‘ having been held to bail ’ ; cf. Cic. ad Att. 16.
6. 3 hoc quod satisdato debeo. Others take zadato=illi qui eum vadatus
erat, ‘ the man who had summoned him ’ 3 cf. Livy 3. 13 tot vadibus accusa-tor
vadatus est reum .· but respmuiere is always in this sense used absolutely.
38. si me amas: hiatus in the first thesis of the dactyl; cf. 2. 2. 28 cocto
‘num adest ; Virg. Ecl. 8. 108 oredimus? an, qui aonam ,· Aen. 6. 507 ἐξ, amice,
nequivi. This hiatus is common in Lucretius and Catullus: see Munro on
Lucr. 2. 404. hic, in the forum, close to which they were. ades, ‘give
me your help in court,' i.e. give me the support of your presence, as an advo-
catus, 39. valeo stare: (1) ‘if I am able to appear as an advocate in
court? starezadesse, cf. Plaut. Men. 5. 2. 47 hinc stas illinc cau-sam dicis,-
Rud. 4. 4. 57 atque nunc abs te stat .· verum hinc cibit testiwwnium. (2) ‘it' I
am strong enough to stand so long in court! So Comm. Cruq. 41. rem,
‘ my case! sodes, ‘if you please ’ (si audes) ; cf. Ep. 1. 1. 62 n.

43. Maecenas quomodo tecum τ so. vivit or agit, ‘ how does Maecenas
stand with you 2’ 44. repetit, ‘ he resumes ' at the point he left off, line 25.
Orelli, Schiitz‚ and others give all that follows, down to omma in 48, to the

paucorum hominum . . . usus the answer of Horace. Thztt paucorum hominum -
'et mentis bene sanae are the words of Horace seems clear ; but it would give
equally good sense whether we assign nemo . . . usus to the stranger or to
Horace. paucorum hominum, ‘a man of few acquaintances'; cf. the
play in Ter. Eun. 3. 1. 19 immo sic homo est perpetuom-um hominum. Gn.
&mmo 'nullorum arbitror, si tecum vivit. Horace gives the intruder a hint
there is no use in his trying to force his way into the narrow circle. bene
sanae: of thoroughly sound mind (not to be taken in by every pushing fellow).

45. nemo dexterius fortuna est usus, ‘ no one ever dealt more adroitly
with Fortune,' or ‘no one ever employed his high position more happily ’ than
Maecenas. Horace seems to mean that Maecenas is not carried away by his
high position, but that he soberly and discreetly chooses his friends, not ready
to listen to every flatterer. Those who assign these words to the intruder are
divided between supplying quam Moaecenas and quam tu ; if the latter is right,
we are again embarrassed by two rival interpretations: ‘there never was a
cleverer fellow than you,’ zze. in making your way into the society of one whom
you describe as so exclusive : or, 6 never was a man luckier than you in meeting

me.’ 46. secundae: sc. partes: la second fiddle to you: act as

fallimur et quondam ‘non diqnum tradimua 48. summosses ἐ ‘ clear out
of your way ' : cf. Od. 2. 16. 10. The pluperf. is much stronger than mammo-
veras: the action is contemplated as at once performed: so rapidly that it is
a thing to be looked back upon. ’

50. malie, abl„ ‘ a greater stranger to vices like these.’ inquam,
emphatic, ‘ I can tell you,' much better than umquam of some MSS. 53.
