ODE II

‘ To attempt to rival Pindar is as vain as the attempt of Icarus to fly. Il e is
like a mountain-torrent swollen by the rain, rushiny and roariny alongy with
deep-mouthecl thuncler. He is the prinae ospoets whether he composes dithmambs,
paeane, hymns of victory or diryes which make the fame of the dead ilndyiny.
He like a swan soars into the shy, I am bat like a bee laboriously yatheriny
a little honey. Yon, Iulus, are more fitted in statelier strains to sing] of the
return of Caesar from his triumphs over the Syyambri—ansar the yreatest
blessiny that heaven has ever conferrecl on earth. You shall siny of the

C. Julius Antonius was son of M. Antonius the triumvir and Fulvia,
and was brought up by his step-mother Octavia the sister of Augustus, through
whose influence he obtained the favour of the Emperor and was made praetor
Β.0. 13 and consul Β.0. 10. Η3 is said to have written an epic poem called
the Diomedeia. Τ113 Ode is a lyric apology for attempting the task 10 which
Horace devotes himself in Odes 4, 5, 14 and 15, and at the same time affords
him opportunities of paying a compliment to Antonius and indirectly cele-
brating the exploits of Augustus.

⁶ 1. Pindarum aemulari z aemulari with the 300. is used of an honest and
noble rivalry, with the dative of mean and ignoble envy. 2. Iule. If this
word is correct the name must have been given him to mark his connexion
with the great Julius (Iulius, a mayno demisswm nomen Iulo, Virg. Aen. 1.
288), the mother of M. Antonius having been J ulia, sister of L. Caesar, cons.
Β.0. 64, but considering (1) that Horace addresses him in line 26 as Antoni,
(2) the difficulty of either eliding the initial i or treating the word as a dis-
syllable, (3) 1113 fact that the word seems elsewhere applied only to the son of
Aeneas, there see-ms great probability in favour of Peerlkamp's conjecture ille.
ceratis . . . ‘rests on wings J'oined with wax by the skill of Daedalus,
doomed 10 give a name to the glassy sea,' i.e.‚ apart from metaphor‚ he who
seeks to rival Pindar is attempting what nature has forbidden and will fail
disastrously. For Daedalus see Class. Dict. and 1. 3. 34 11.
