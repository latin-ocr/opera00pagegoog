450 HORACE Boox 11

avarus (Juv. 14. 178) is here supposed to strangle his wife and poison his
mother sor their money. He is mad, as mad as Orestes, The points of
differenoe are immaterial, 132. Orestes, it is true, used steel, and did the
deed at Argos, not at Rome. But let the avarus compare himself with him
before he actually slew his mother, and these points cannot be urged. 132.
quid enim? a conversational phrase=rl γάρ, ‘of course‚' cf. 1. 1. 7. ‘Are
you sane? Of course. You do not do this at Argos etc.,’ the last sentence
being ironical. Argis: cf. Ep. 2. 2. 128 n. 137. male tutae=male
sanae, insanam cf. Od. 1. 9. 24 n. 141. Orestes calls Electra a Fury,
Eur. Or. 264 μέθες · μί’ οὖσα τῶν ἑμῶν Ἐρινύων Ι μέσον μ’ ὀχμάζεις, ὡς βάλῃς
εἰς Τάρταρον. No such abuse of Pylades is found in any extant tragedy.
splendida bilis: ‘his shining bile,’ from the physical appearance of black
bile, which the ancients regarded as the cause of madness (μελαγχολίαι) ; cf.
Galen, περὶ αἰτ. συμπτ. 2. 50 μέλαινα χολὴ στιλπνοτέρα, (more glistening)
αὐτοῦ τοῦ αἵματός ἐστιν, and he compares it to bitumen from the Dead Sea ;
Persius 3. 8 vitrea bilis.

142. pauper, ‘poor in,’ cf. Od. 3. 30. 11 pauper aquae. Opimius (the
name is selected from its resemblance to opes, opimus) was rich in gold and
silver3 but as he was afraid to use his riches, it came to the same thing as
being poor: he was maynas inter opes inops (Od. 3. 16. 28). So all editors,
but how could Opimius be called ‘ poor in silver stored up '22 he was surely
‘rich in silver stored up ’ and only ‘poor thouqh he had silver stored up.’
143. Veientanum: a very poor redwine, called Veientanum ‘rubellum by Pers.
5. 147, and Mart. 1. 103. 9. It was the best wine Opimius allowed himself,
however. 144. campana trulla, ‘out of a mug of Campanian(cf. 1. 6. 118 n.)
pottery ’ ε it is not quite clear what trulla means here : it sometimes means a
wine-scoop, and some think it means here that Opimius used no poculum, or
cup, which was too large, but drank out of the trulla, or wine-scoop itself.
vappam: 1. 1. 104. profestis: 2. 2. 116. 147. multum
celer: multum is often used as an adv. strengthening adJ’ectives in the
Satires: 1. 3. 57 m. demissus; 2. 5. 67 m. nequem& 2. 5. 92 m. similis.
This use is common in Plautus, and is another instance of Horace’s use of the
sermo quotidianus 149. plures, ‘ several people.’

152. hoc age, ‘give me your whole attention.' hoc aye was a formula
commonly used at sacrifices, by which the complete attention of those present
was demanded. Hence hoc cogere in Latin is perpetually ‘to do a thing with
your might.’ Of. Ep. 1. 6. 31 ; Munro on Lucret. 1. 41. 154. ingens:
a very strong word is purposely chosen to rouse the man from his stupor.
fultura: fulcire is often used of food, e.9. Lucr. 4. 867 propterea capitur cibus
ut suffulciat artus, So we speak of taking ‘support' Here the word is
contrasted with ruenti .· ‘ the support ’ is to keep the stomach from ‘giving ⁹
or ‘ collapsing.' 155. tisanarium: properly a diminutive of πτισάνη,
barley (πτίσσω, ‘ to winnow ') a decoction of barley‚ then transferred to any
decoction ; here of rice, ‘ rice-gruel! Of. Plin. H. N. 18. 7. 71 (Indi) omaeime
oryza qaudam ew qua tisanam conficiunt, quam reliqici mortales ex hordeo.
156. quanti ergo, ‘well, but how much 2 ' repeating his previous question
with emphasis 157. pereamque: for que joined to the verb instead of
its noun, cf. Od. 3. 4. 11 ludo fatiyatumque somna -que is much better than
ve which has very poor authority. furtis rapinisque are opposed as one idea
to morbo z there are not three co-ordinateffi
