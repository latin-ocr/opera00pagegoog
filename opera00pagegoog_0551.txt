EPISTLE XII

In Od. 1. 29 Iccius is represented as about to joiu the unsuccessful expedition
of Aelius Gallus against the Arabs (25 B.c.)‚ and Horace makes merry over his
abandonment of philosophical studies for military aspirations. From this
Epistle‚ written about five years later (line 26), we leam that he had been
placed iu charge of the Sicih'an estates of Agrippa, and that he was now acting
as his agent (procurator), a position with which, Horace tells him, he ought to
be well content. Agrippa had doubtless received laud 111 Sicily in acknowledg-
ment of his services in the war against Sextus Pompeius (36 13.c.)‚ possibly also
when he was summoned to Sicily to marry the emperor’s daughter ‚Julia (22
EC.) This letter seems to be an answer to one fro 1 Iccius, in which he appears
to have lamented that the claims of his dutie ft him little leisure for his
studies. Pompeius Grosphus, to whom Od. ¹ 16 is addressed and whom
Horace here introduces to his friend, was a rich icilian knight.
