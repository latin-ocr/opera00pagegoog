spatiere, ‘that you may strut proudly in the circus.' latus refers to the
expanded toga (cf. Epod. 4. 8)‚ras ,well as to the mental elation, the swagger,
of a man pacing proudly along. For this meaning of latus cf. Cic, Acad. 2.
41. 127 erigimur, latiores fieri videmur, humana despicimus (v. l. elatiores„
altiores); Sen. Ep. 76. 31 cum praesente populo lati (v.l. elati) incesserunt
et cothurnati, simul emierunt excalceantur et ad staturam suam redeunt. The ,
magistrate struts about the course during the intervals of racing as officials are
always fond of doing. Palmer points out that there is no evidence for such
promenading on the part of the praetor, and suggests altus . . . spectere.
stes: of a statue, like 'ponet marnwream Od. 4. 1. 20 ; statuaris Ov. Her. 2. 67.
185. Μ. Vipsanius Agrippa (cf. Od. 1. 6 Intr.) was aedile 33 Β.0., when
this satire was probably written. His aedileship was famous for its magnifi-
cenee. 186. vulpes: the fable of the 1οΧ 111 1116 11011’6 skin is referred to :

see 1. 6. 22; 2. 1. 64.

187. The madness of AJax occurs to the mind of the speaker, and he shows
that the man whose notions of right and wrong are so confused as to lead him
to commit a crime for the sake of glory (ob titulos inanes) is just as mad.
Agamemnon is as ‘mad as Ajax. The poet has in view the scene at the end
of the AJax of Sophocles, where Agamemnon and Menelaus forbid Teucer to
bury the body of Ajax. ne quis . . . velit : taken from the language of
ancient statutes, e. 9. in the S. O. de Bacchanalibus .· ‘ne quis eorum baccanal
habuisse velet. velit: 1. 5. 90. Atrida: here voc. of Atrida, the early
Latinised form, through the Aeolic dialect3 but Atride Ep. 1. 7. 43, voc„
after the regular Greek model. 188. plebeius : from this word some have
supposed the dialogue 10 116 imagined between Agamemnon and a common
soldier ; but it is better 10 suppose it as an imaginary conversation between a
Stoic, like Stertinius himself, and Agamemnon. He calls himself plebum,
conveying a rebuke on the arrogance of the king’s rex sum, which the latter
feels‚ and at once moderates his tone. 191. The prefatory wish in Homer,
Il. 1. 18 ὑμῖν μὲν θεοὶ δοῖεν Ὀλύμπια δώματ’ ἔχοντες Ι ἐκπέρσαι Πριάμοιο
πόλιν ἐὺ δ’ οἴκαδ’ ἱκέσθαι. reducere occurs. with the first syllable long
in Lucretius l. 228 ; 4. 992 ; 5. 1337, where the best MSS. mostly
give redducere. Some copyistS‚ offended by a seeming licence, give deducere
here. 192. consulere, respondere : to question and answer in my turn.

193. ab Achille secundus, ‘next after Achilles,' the position regularly
awarded to Ajax by Greek writers, Il. 2. 768 ; Od. 11. 550 ; Soph. Aj. 1339.
For this use of ab cf. J uv. 10. 126 volveris a prima quae proxima ,· Virg. Ecl.
5. 49 fortunate puer, tu nunc eris alter ab illo. 195. ut, ‘is it in order
111612’ ἢ ἵνα,· Theline is a reminiscence of Il. 1. 255 ἦ κεν ’γηθήσαι Πρίαμος
Πριάμοιό τε παῖδες. inhumato : 60. illo (Aiace). 197. mille ovium :
mille is always used as a subst. followed by a genitive in Plautus, sometimes
in the best age : the plural, milia, is always a subst. See on 1. 6. 111. Τ1116
16 1116 only passage where Horace uses mille as a noun : he uses it twelve times
as adj. morti dedit ε cf. Pind. Ol. 2. 82 θανάτῳ πόρεν. 198. occidere,
‘that he was actually slaying.' 199. natam, Iphigenia: see Class. Dict.

200. mola salsa: of. Od. 3. 27. 20 11. 201. rectum . . . cursum:
cf. 2. 5. 78 recto depellere cursu. MSS. give rectum animi servas? quorsum? but
quorsumzquorsum haec tendunt (cf. 2. 7. 21) seems unwan-antea, and Bothe's
cursum seems certain. 202. abstinuit Vim : the transitive use of abstinere
is common in the comio writers and Cicero, especially with acc. of pronounS,
and with manus, iram, etc. This is its literal meaning, to ‘keep off‚' like
