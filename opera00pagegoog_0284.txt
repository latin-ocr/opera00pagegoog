256 HORACE 130οΚ 11

personified, the usual term being Hesperus, Both words are identical with
ἕσπερος, 1110 rough breathing in Greek appearing in Latin as either h or v.
The same star when it appears in the morning is called Isaczfer and Φωσφόρος ;
cf. Tennyson, In Mem. 0. 120 ‘Sweet Hesper—Phosphor, double name Ι For
what is one! 12. rapidum: in artistic contrast with fugiente. Lucifer
flies before the 81111 when he comes forth ‘ as a giant to run his course.'

13. ter aevo functus, ‘who had passed through three generations.’
aevum appears to mean a space of about 30 years, ‘a generation.’ Men on
, 1110 average have children at about the age of 30 (one generation), grandchildren
· (the second generation) at 60, and great-grandchildren (the third generation)
at 90. Hence a man of 90 may be said to have ‘passed through three
generations.’ Horace is copying Homer’s description of Nestor, ΙΙ. 1. 250 ἥδη δύο
μὲν γενεαὶ μερόπων ἀνθρώπων Ι ἐφθίατο . . . μετὰ δὲ τριτάτοισιν ἄνασσεν.
amabilem:- ‘though so loveable ’ ; so below inpubem: ‘though cut off in
the flower of his youth.' 14. Antilochum: slain by Memnon. 16.
Troilon: slain by Achilles 3 cf. Virg. Aen. 1. 475 infelix puer atque inpar
coozqressus Achilli. Phrygiae sorores, ae. Cassandra, Polyxena, etc.
Phrygiae, ‘Trojan.' The historical Phrygia would not include Troy.

17. semper: emphatic by position. Horace dwells all through not on
the folly of sorrow but of ceaseless sorrow. Cf. semper line 1 ; usque 43
menses per omnes 6 ; semper 9 ; omnes omncs 143 semper 17 ; tandem 18.
desine mollium querellarum, ‘ cease those womanly laments.' desine
takes a gen. on the analogy of Gk. words, such as λήγειν, παύεσθαι,
etc. Cf. 4. 9. 35 11. 19. tropaea. See Intr. Tropaeum=rpovra20v‚ a
memorial set up by the victors at the spot where the enemy's line was
‘turned back ’ (τρέπω). 20. rigidum Niphaten, ‘frozen N iphates‚’ a
mountain of Armenia. 21. Medumque flumen . . . vertices The
construction changes to 000. and inf. 3 ‘ and that the Persian stream (73.0. 1110
Euphrates) . . . rolls its eddying waves less proudly and the Geloni within
fixed limits career over narrowed plains.’ For MeduszParthian cf. 2. 1.
31 n. The same event is alluded to by Virgil in similar terms, Aen. 8. 726
Euphrates ibat iam mollior ’κω-Ζῶ,- Gr. 4. 560. For minores volvere
vertices cf. R. C. Trench, The Alma: ‘Alma, roll thy waters proudly, Ι

Proucssy roll them to the sea.’ 23. Gelonos : a nomad tribe of Scythians ,

who, like the modern Cossacks‚ roamed over the wide steppes (eampis) by the

gssngssgorggog’zssand made raids 011 horseback (equitare) into Roman territory.

ODE X

An Ode on the virtue of moderation, as⁴ the true lesson to be derived from
philosophy and experience (see n. on line 5). Licinius Murena, afterwards
called A. Terentius Varro Murena, was the brother of the Proculeius of 2.
2. 5, and of Terentia, wife of Maecenas. According to Dion Cassius 54. 3
ἀκράτῳ καὶ κατακορεΐ παρρησίᾳ πρὸς πάντας ὁμοίως ἐχρῆτο, 50 11101 110 must
have been singularly wanting 111 1110 virtue which Horace, perhaps designedly‚
here selects for praise. He joined 'Fannius Caepio in a conspiracy against
Augustus B.c. 22, and was put to death. Cf. 100 3. 19. 11.

1. rectius. The adj. ‘rectus is used by writers on moral philosophy as
almostz-lzonestus, to indicate ‘that which is in accordance with the moral
standard' (regula, from 7090), ‘what is morally right ' 3 and rectum as a
noun represents the Stoic κατόρθωμα-τ ‘ a morally right act performed with a
