48. pariter, i.e. like your patron. pulmenta = pulmentaria, Of· S· 2· 2·
20 n. 49. sollemne opus : in apposition to the preceding clause, not an
independent proposition. Hunting is called Rmnana militia S. 2. 2. 10.

53. coronae, ‘the ring’ of spectators: cf. A. P. 381 ; Mart. 7. 72. 9 sic
palmam tibi . . . unctae det favor arbiter coronae. 54. proelia cam-
pestria, the fencing matches and similar amusements of the Campus Martius.
55. Cantabrica bella, i.e. in 27 -25 B.c. z cf. Od. 2. 6. 2 n. 56. refigit,
‘is taking down’: Od. 1. 28. 11 clipeo . . . refixo. For the recovery of the
standards of Crassus from the Parthians in 20 B.c.‚ cf. Od. 1. 2. 22 n.

58. ac . . . nugaris : the clause ne . . . absis is parentheticffl, and
suggests, not the purpose of the principal action, but the reason of mentioning
it: Roby 1660, S. G. 690. ‘And further—that you may not back out, etc.—
you do sometimes go into the country and amuse yourself.’ 59. quamvis . . .
curas: for the indicative cf. S. 2. 2. 30 n. extra numerum=⁷rapa τὸν
ῥυθμὸν (τοῦ βίου) : extra medum=⁷rapa μέλος, ‘ out of time and tune.’ 61.
exercitus, ‘ your forces‚’ i.e. of slaves. Actia pugna: Virg. Aen. 8. 675

15. 10 n. 62. hostili more, i.e. quasi re vera hostes inter vos essetis.

2. 25 pellicea cum faveamus, premere etiam proverbio iubemur. 'Phe opposite to
this is pollicem vertere: cf. Juv. 3. 36 verso pollice mclyi, eum libet, occidunt
mutar-tter, where Mayor writes ‘ those who wished the death of a conquered
gladiator turned (vertebant, convertebant) their thumbs towards their breasts,
as a signal to his opponent to stab him : those who wished him to be spared
turned their thumbs downwards (premebant), as a signal for dropping the sword.’

67 -85, Be careful of your words : avoid curicus questions: do not allow
yoursetf to be enamoured of any of your patron’s household .· be cautious in
introductam, and do not attempt to defend the unworthy. 68. de quoque,
perhaps best taken=et de quo: there are three questions quid diem, de quo
dieas, cui dica-3. So Cic. in Pis. 31. 75 tu quid, tu apud quos, tu de quo dieaS,
intelleqis? It is however quite legitimate to take quoque as abl. of quisque
and then it implies that in each individual ca'se care is to be used. 71.
emissum, ‘let slip 'z A. P. 390 nescit vom missa reverti. The generally
assumed reference to an arrow hardly allows sufficiently for the idea of care-
lessness here involved. Cf. Menander, Frag. 607 οὔτ’ ἐκ χερὸς μεθέντα καρ-
τερᾶς λίθον Ι ῥᾷον κατασχεῖν, οὔτ’ ἀπὸ ’γλώσσης λόγον.

Od. 1. 13. 4 n. 75. beet aut . . . angat: if the patron grants your
request, he will think that he has discharged all obligations, though his gift is
really of little value: if he is churlish and refuses you, this will cause you pain.

78. quondam. ‘at times’: cf. Od. 2. 10. 18 ; S. 2. 2. 82; Virg. Aen. 2.
367 quondam etiam vietis redit in praecordia virtus: cf. ib. 6. 877. It is doubtful
whether this usage is found in CicerO. cf. the similar use of olim. tranmUS,
‘ introduce' ; cf. 1. 9. 3. 79. premet, ‘crushes,' with a stronger force
than in 1. 19. 36. 80. ut . . . serves. If you have been deceived and
have introduced a man who proves unworthy, do not attempt to stand by him,
in order that you may not exhaust your influence, but may preserve it unim-
paired sor the protection of one whom you know well, and who looks to yon
