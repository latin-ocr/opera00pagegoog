556 HORACE BOOK 11

Hercules by Eurystheus were made obligatory by the cunning of J uno, who
had induced Jupiter to swear that the descendant of Perseus born first on
that day should rule the other. 12. supremo, ‘only by his last end,'
‘ by death at last,' but by nothing before.

13. urit : two metaphors are combined: genius outshines and dims every-
thing, while it also presses on and galls spirits of lower degree. For urit in
this latter sense, cf. 1. 13. 6 yravis uret sarcina. See Kiessling. artes:
ἐπιτηδεύματα, ‘ qualities': cf. Od. 3. 3. 9. 15. praesenti, ‘while still
with us‚' as contrasted with the demi - gods who received honours only
after their deaths. Augustus is the one exception to the rule virtutem
incolumem odimus Od. 3. 24. 31. 16. iurandas aras: iurare takes
an accusative of that by which one swears (Virg. Aen. 12. 197 terram,
mare, sidera iuro) : hence it can be used in the passive. numen: so vet.
Bland., though most MSS. have nomen, but these words are constantly con-
fused, and the regular phrase is not iurare per numen but iurare in nomen, see
Dict. Mommsen holds that this phrase cannot refer either to the altar to
Fortuna redux dedicated when Augustus returned to Rome in 19 B.c., or to
that of Pax Auyusta of July, 13 B.c., because neither of these deities could
have found a place in oaths. It must refer, he holds», to the invocation of the
¹cenius Augusti between Iuppiter optimus maximus and the Di Penates, which
was part of the remodelling of the worship of the Lares Compitales, This
appears to have been due to a decree of the senate, passed during the Emperor's
absence, although not fully carried out until a later date. Cf. Od. 4. 5. 34
Laribus tuum Ι miscet numen ; Corp. I. Lat. 2. 172 si sciens fallo fefellerove,
tum me liberosque meos Iupiter optimus maximus ac clivus Auyustus ceterique
omnes di immortales expertem patria incolumitate fortunisque omnibus faciant
(found at·Aritium vetus in Lusitania).

18-27. But in other res-pects the Romans now scorn contemporary merit,
and are blindly partiat to what is ancient. 18. tuus hie, ‘this people of
thine,' i.e. the Roman people‚ so devoted to thee. 21. suis temporibus,
‘the measure of life assigned to them.' The epithet which would more
properly belong to the authors is transferred to their works. 23. veterum,
neuter, not masculine, as is shown by cetera, semota, and defunctam cf.
Tac. Ann. 2. 88 vetera extollimus recentium incuriosi. tabulas, the laws
of the XII Tables, carried by the decemvirs. 25. Gabiis: supply
cum from the following clause; cf. line 31 n. Dionysius Halic. (4. 58) says
that he saw in the temple of Ζεὺς πίστιος on the Quirinal a treaty made by
Tarquinius Superbus with Gabii, written on the hide of the ox slain at the
ratification of the treaty. aequata, ‘ made on equal terms‚' an unexampled
force of the word. 26. pontificum libros: properly the books con-
taining the laws of ritual and worship (Cic. de Orat. 1. 43. 193; Macrob-
S. 1. 12. 21), but probably including also the annales pontificum or annales
maximi. Cf. Cic. de Orat. 2. 12. 52 where Cicero speaks of the entire abse ’ 6
of ornament in their style. volumina vatum: the oracles of the Sil yl
were written in Greek ; but there were current at Rome certain carmina M r·
ciana in Saturnian verse, ascribed to a prophetie Marcius (Livy 25. 12 3 {guy
H. N. 7. 33), which foretold the defeat of Cannae, and enjoined gam, in
honour of Apollo. Their date is unknown. 27. dictitet . . . 222³. he
asserts that these dull old documents are the perfection of style. There seems
to have been a. grove dedicated to the Camenae (and especially to Egeria) at
Aricia at the foot of the Alban mount.
