omi: v NOTES 289

‘Lyciam' ‘wolf-slaying‚’ or ‘light-giving,’ see L. and Scott‚ S.v. 63.
natalem silvam: on Mt. Cynthus in Delos. See class, Dict. s.v. Leto.

65. vis consili . . . ‘ strength void of judgment falls by its own weight :
strength self· controlled the gods also increase more and more: but they
abhor the strong whose thoughts are busy with all impie-ty? The ‘ maxims ’
(sententiae line 70, γνῶμαι) here enunciated express the moral lesson to be
deduced from the defeat of the giants and are illustrated by the statement of
their punishment (lines 73-77) and by the fate of Orion, Tityos, and Pirithous.
vis . . . vim . . . vires: usually vis: ‘violence,' mres: ‘strength‚' but
here no such distinction is to be drawn. mole ruit sua: the metaphor is
from a building which is reared to such a size that it falls in. 67. idem,
‘but they a150‚' cf. 2. 10. 16 n. vires, ‘strength,' ie. the strong; cf.
animo in next line. 68. omne nefas animo moventes. Observe the
assonance in ne ne, mo mo. 69. Gyas: 2. 17. 14 n. 70. notus
et . . . ‘and Orion too notorious as tho assailant of the spotless Diana.'

73. iniecta . . . ‘piled on her own monsters Earth groans, and mourns
her brood hurled by the thunderbolt to ghastly Orcus. Τὴε giants were the
offspring of earth, hence called monstra sua ,· cf. ’γίγαντες as if from γαῖα, and
γίγνομαι. 75. peredit: perfect. The giants were pinned to the ground
with a thunderbolt‚ and then had a mountain piled upon them τ the volcanic
nature of Etna and similar mountains was supposed to be due to the fire thus
planted at their base, and their eruptions to the agonised writhings of the
giants. 77. Tityi: 2. 14. 8 11. 78. reliquit, ‘has lest‚’ i.e. from the time
when it was placed there. nequitiae additus custos. The use of
additus is noticeable: it implies that the warder thus ‘assigned to his profli-
gacy' could not be got rid of. cf. Virg. Aen. 6. 90 nec Teucris addita Iuno

Ι usquam aberit ; Stat. Theb. 2. 320 mortalibus addita cura ,· Plaut. Aul. 3. 6.
20 custodem addidit. 79. amatorem, ‘per λιτότητα pro scelesto raptore‚’
Orelli. trecentae, i.e. any indefinite number: so more commonly sexcenti.
Pirithous attempted to carry off Proserpine. It has been well suggested that
the mythological instances selected by Horace in these stanzas are selected
with a definite purpose : they are all instances of those whom lust has ruined
-temptator Orion, incontinens Tityos, amator Pirithous, Considering to
whom the Ode is addressed and whose victories are suggested, there can be
little doubt who the fallen foe hinted at is,--the Roman Antony who had

perished in the meshes of Cleopatra. For similar eloquent omissions of his
name cf. 1. 37 Int., 3. 8. 18 n.

ODE V

‘ Jove is king! of heaven and Auyustue his viceqerent on earth, as shall be
manifest, when he has added Britain and Parthia to his empire. And yet
(thouyh Rome's fortune and Rome’s future are thus asem-ed) could the soldiers
of Crassus condes-cenot to pwrchase their lives by repudiatiny their reliqion and
their race and acceptinq the life of barbarian-s? It was euch a decay of the
true spirit of national honour that Reyulue foresaw and sear-ed when he refused
assent to diehonovmable terme, as involviny a precedent which would be fatal to
ages yet unborn. “Na'' he said, “ let those who surrendered perieh unpitied.
Why should you sech to recover such men? Once cowards they will be always
so. Thinh how they have yiven-ylory to Carthaqe and brouqht Italy low even
to the dust.’' And then unthout one kiss to wife or child as one disyraced,
without raisinq his eyes from the 9round until he had confirmed the waverinq
senate in their stem resolve, he hastened back to exile, to torture and to death.’
