PREFAOE

THIS edition is an abridgment 01 the three volumes devoted
to Horace in “ Macmillan's Classical SerieS,'' and owes its
origin to representations made by many schoolmasters to the

‚publishers as to the need existing for an edition 01 Horace with

notes in 6 single volume. In the execution 01 my task I have
been guided by the experience derived from actual use 01 the
separate editions in form, and my aim has been simply to cut
out such portions 01 the notes as seemed least important 101·
young studentS, leaving the remainder, as 161 as possible,
unaltered. The work has not been altogether easy or
congenial. The charm 01 6 note often lies in that part which
is least strictly relevant, and comment is often most interest—
ing when most discursive, nor is it a simple process to curtail
without destroying, and to “ be brief '² without “becoming
obscure.'' On the other hand there can be no question as to
the convenience 01 having an author complete between two
coverS, and 101 most boys notes, in order to be used, must be
moderate in length. In the present instance there are slightly
more than two pages 01 notes to one 01 text, and, perhaps, in
the case of a writer like Horace that represents¹ 611 almost
irreducible minimum 01 comment, unless it is held desirable to
abbreviate notes into mere dogmatic statements specially
designed 101 use in the examination-room.
