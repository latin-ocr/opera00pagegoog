21. divesne . . . Τ116 construction is nil interest divesne (sis) . . . an . . .
moreris-‘it makes no difference whether you are rich or . . . lodge under
the canopy of heaven, (seeing that you are) a victim of the unpitying grave.'
The way in which the words m'etima . . . Orci are to be taken is shown by
their emphatic position. Latin suffers from not possessing a part. of the verb
‘ to be,' and is compelled to make clear the way a word is to be taken by as·
signing it a very marked position, as here. In Gk. after victima we should
have ὤν 01· ὢν ὅμως, cf. 3. 16. 30 and 4. 1. 6 n. ; in English we must add ‘as
being’ or ‘ seeing that you are.’ Inacho : a mythical king of Argos ; he
here typifies remote antiquity and lofty lineage. 23. sub divo, ‘ beneath
the open sky,’=.s·ub Iove 1. 1. 25 n. So too 1. 18. 13 sub divum, ‘into the
open aii-‚⁹ ‘ into the light! The phrase is archaic. moreris: either
‘ lodge ’ (-- commoreris), or ‘linget-,² since life is only mora mortis (Kiessling).

25. cogimur: 6090, stom coa90=‘to drive together.’ The idea is the
same as in 1. 24. 18 (nigro compulerit φερέ) of the dead being collected like
a flock of sheep. 26. versatur sors exitura. The ancient method of
drawing lots was by writing the names on pebbles, which were then cast into
an urn which was shaken about (versatur) until one lot leapt out (exire).
Hence in Gk. πάλος (a lot), from πάλλω ‘to shake? So 3. 1. 16 omne capax
movet urna nomen. serius ocius, ‘ sooner or later.’ 28. cumbae,
i.e. the well-known bark of Charon, described in Virg. Aen. 6. 410-414, and

cf. Prop. 3. 18. 24·swndenda est torvi publica cumba senis,

ODE IV

‘ Lest you be cosham, Xanthia-9, ofyowr love foo- a slave-girl, let me tell you
many a hero has done the sames—Achillea, A Jaae, Ayamemnon. And who
knows bui your aubwrn-haired Phyllis may have been a princess once 2 Be sure
there was nothing disreputable about the mother of such a paraqooz, such. a
nay, you may let me praisc her without suspicion ,· I am close οη foa-ty!

The Ode is satirical, and the style mock-heroic: Xanthias Phoceus is a
nom-cle-plume, and, as usual, Horace selects a Gk. name (specum-:inhabitant
of Phocis), cf. 2. 5. 20 Cnidiusve ques ,· 3. 12. 6 Liparaei Hebri.

1. ne sit. When ‘ne is used in prohibitions the perfect subj. (cf. 1. 11. 1
ne quaesieris) is regular, and it is therefore better here to take it: ‘ lest,' cf.
1. 33. 1 ; 2. 1. 37; 4. 9. 1. sit tibi pudori: pudori is ‘Dat. of the
Purpose‚' which is usually found with a second Dat. of the Recipient‚ cf. odio
esse alteri, ewwlumenlo esse alicui, etc. 2. Xanthia=EavOla. in-
solentem, ‘ arrogant though he was ’ : see his character, A. P. 121. For
Achilles and Briseis see Class. Dict. 4. movit . . . movit: 1. 2. 4 11.

5. Telamone natum added to distinguish him from AjaX, son of Oileus,
for whom cf. 1. 15. 18. 6. captivae dominum. Τ116 antithesis is made
clearer by the juxtaposition of the antithetical words. In a non-inflecting
language, such as English, the order of the words in a sentence being of
necessity more simple for the sake of clear-mss, it is comparatively rarely
that this placing contrasted words side by side can be effected. Other
instances are 1. 6. 9 tenues qrandia, 1. 13. 14 dulcia barbare, 1. 15. 2 perfidus
hospitam, 1. 29. 10 arduis prono-3, 1. 37. 6 Capitolio regrina, 3. 5. 9 Medo
Marsus, 4. 4. 31 inbellem feroces Ι proqenera‘nt aquilae columbam ,- 4. 5. 9,
16. Tecmessae, Τέκμησσα. ‘ Before ym, 9η, a vowel seems always to
have become long by nature, as temneat, aquus. In genuine Latin words not
