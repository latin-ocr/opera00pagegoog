592 HORAOE Ans

nervus, like νεῦρον, always denotes sinews or tendons (literal or metaphorical);
cf. Celsus 8. 1 nervi quos τένοντας Graeci appellant, but sometimes appears
to include also what we call ‘ nerveS.' Galen (born A.D. 130) was the first to
limit νεῦρον to the meaning ‘nerve‚’ in its present sense. 27. animi,
‘ spirit.’ professus grandia t cf. Quint. 10. 2. 16 plerumque (imitatores)
declinant in peius et proxima virtutibus vilia comprehendant fiuntque pro
,qrandibas tumidi. 28. Serpit humi: Horace mixes the metaphors of one
who fears to soar and so creeps along the ground, and of a sailor who hugs
the shore in his dread of a storm3 cf. Od. 2. 10. 1 seq. Perhaps there is a
reference to pedestris oratic. 29. prodigialiter occurs in good Latin only
here and Colum. 3. 3. 3. In Plaut. Amph. 732 prodiyialis Iuppiter is the
god who sends marvels, Hence the word seems to mean ‘ so as to produce a
marvellous effect.’ ··Wickham gives ‘by exceeding the bounds of nature.’
unam: perhaps better taken as merely denoting ‘ one and the sa1ne‚'
rather than as ‘simple' 30. delphinum: the Gk. δελφίν or δελφίς be-
comes usually delphinus in Latin, as ἐλέφας becomes elephantu33 but Ovid
has twice delphin as the nom. (found occasionally in other poets), and five
times delphina as the acc. sing.: Virgil (once Aen. 8. 673) and Ovid (three
times) have delphines as nom. sing„ and Virgil (Ecl. 8. 56) has delphinas as
acc. plur. Ovid has the abl. delphine in Met. 11. 237, and the gen. plur.
delphinum is found thrice in Virgil and once in Propertius. But these Gk.
forms are entirely confined to poetry.

32. Aemilium ludum, according to Porph. a gladiatorial school near
the Forum, built by an Aemilius Lepidus, who cannot now be identified.
imus was confessedly the reading of the archetype, but Bentley's conjecture
‘anus (= ‘ better than any one else ') has found much acceptation. Rider,
Kriiger and Schiitz are, however, right in defending imus: ‘ the lowest in
rank,' i.e. the poorest‚ or most unskilful. It is surely legitimate to say ‘ the
poorest smith who lives by the Aemilian school will represent you nails, and
imitate waving hair in bronze ' : and if so, there is no reason to depart from
the MSS. Jordan (Hermes 9. 416 seq.) shows that probably around the outer
walls of the ludus there were tabernae, let out to fabri by the builder or
lessee of the school: he, however (and so Kiessling), gives imus a local sense:
‘ dwelling in the last or bottom shop ' ; cf. Porphyrion in anyulo ludi taber-
nam habentem. Orelli, who read unae, seems wrong in regarding elaborate
accuracy in the representation of the hair as a great merit in a sculptor.
After the path had once been pointed out (according to Pliny, H. N. 34. 8. 19,
by Pythagoras of Rhegium) it was not hard to follow it. 33. molles,
‘waving‚’ as often in Virgil‚ ay. Ecl. 3. 45 molli acantho ,· applied to hair by
Tibull. 1. 8. 9 quid tibi nunc molles prodest. coluisse capillos? 34. infelix
operis summa, ‘ failing in his work as a whole.’ ponere, ‘ represent‚’
often used of plastic art3 cf. Od. 4. 8. 8. 35. me esse velim: cf. Cic. in
Cat. 1. 4 cupio me esse clementem, with note. 36. pravo ε cf. Ep. 2. 2. 44 11.
37. spectandumzdiynum qui specter: cf. Od. 1. 32. 11 Lycum niyris
oculis niyroque Ι crine decorum. ψ

38-41. The subject chosen must be within the poet's powers. 38. aequam
:parem ‘ not too much for? 39. versate, ‘consider ’ 3 cf. Plaut. Trin.
2. 1. 1 mullas ‘res simitu in meo corde corso. ferre recusent: Ep. 2. 1.
258. 40. potenter: Porphyrion explains as=xa7a τὸ δυνατόν, ‘in accord-
ance with his powers,' and this view has been generally adopted, although the
word occurs nowhere else in anything like this sense. May not the meaning
