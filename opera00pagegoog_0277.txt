finished. 22. integer, from in and tauqo (tetiyi), indicates that which is
free from all taint or blemish, or which is complete and whole. ‘I praise‚
myself beart-whole . . . ‚² cf. 3. 7. 22. fuge suspicari, ‘avoid suspecting
one whose age has been only too eager to conclude its eighth lustres For the
inf. cf. 1. 15. 27 n. 23. octavum claudere lustrum. Horace was
born Dec. 8, B.c. 65. lustrum (from luo) = (1) the expiatory sacrifice
performed by the censors at the end of every fifth year aster taking the
census ; and so (2) ‘a space of ‚five years' ; cf. 4. 1. 6 circa lustra decem.
The technical phrase condere lustrum which was used of the censors is
judiciously varied by Horace. trepidavit: a favourite word with Horace,
used, 2. 3. 12, of a stream hurrying down its bed. It expresses eager, excited,
quivering (cf. tremo) motion, cf. 4. 11. 11 and 2. 11. 4 n. For claudere after
a verb of eagerness cf. 1. 15. 27 n. The exact value of the two concluding
lines in fixing the date of the Ode the judicious reader must himself deter-
mine, but cf. Dickens, Sketches by Boz, 6ΜΓ. Augustus Minns was a bachelor
of about forty as he said—of about eight and forty as his friends said.’

ODE V

‘Lalaqe is too young yet for the trials aud troubles of love : her deliqlzt is
still in childislz frolics. Why covel the uuripe yrapc? Wait awhile aud she
will seclo you os herself} ancl be dcarer to you than ever was Pholoe or Chloris!

1. ferre iugum valet. The nom. is Lalaye, or iuvenca to be extracted
from iuvencae, line 6. iuvenca‚=a young girl, is frequent in ancient poetry,
though not in accord with modern taste. The metaphor is kept up through·
out the first eight lines, and repeated in lines 15, 16. Cf. δάμαλις and πόρτις
in Gk. 2. munia comparis aequare, ‘ match the labours of a mate '
01· ‘ yoke-fellow,' rae. draw even with one in the plough. 5. circa est : lit.
‘is around ’ =‘is occupied with! This use of circa is very frequent in
Quintilian and some post-Augustan writers, but otherwise rare. Cf. ἐἶναι περί
τι. 6. nunc . . . nunc, ‘at one time . . . at another.' 9. praeges-
tientis is a very strong word: yeslire (from yestus) ‘to use passionate
gestures' is in itself a very emphatic word for ‘desiring,' and praez‘exceed·
ingly ' makes it more SO. Horace wishes to express how she is given up heart
and soul to her gambols without one thought of love or anything else.

10. iam . . . colore: lividus describes a dull, leaden, somewhat dark
colour (being used of lead, the sea, bruised flesh, bilious people, etc.) and is
specially used of the grape (ε ‘ bluish-grey ’) when Just turning), cf. J uV. 2. 81
uvaque conspecta livorem ducit ab uva, Prop. 4. 2. 12 prima mihi (1.0. Vertumuo)
variat liventibus uva racemis. Hence the sense is clear, ‘ Soon shall many·
coloured Autumn mark for thee the already darkening clusters with purple
hue ' 3 ue. ⁶ Lalage is just turning into a woman and, if you only wait a little,
will be ripe for you.' The rendering ‘ Autumn gaily dressed in brilliant colours
shall mark for thee the clusters with blue ' misses the point, which is that
Lalage and the grapes are already ripening but not ripe. For the twofold
comparison to a grape and a heifer cf. Theocr. 11. 21 μόσχω γαυροτέρα,
φιαρωτέρα ὄμφακος ὠμᾶς. 13. currit . . . aetas, ‘her time of life, now
so wild, hastens along.’ ferox keeps up the metaphor of noudum subacta
cervice ‚· she is still too young to be broken in, wild, untamed. 14.
dempserit, apponet. The body naturally increases in strength up to a
certain age (say forty or forty-five), after which strength and activity gradually
