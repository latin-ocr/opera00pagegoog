ἄλλως ἀποθανεῖν. 42. hio: cf. 1. 6. 40, ‘such an one! 44. unctum,
‘richer’ of food, as in 1. 17. 12 of persons; cf. Mart. 5. 44. 7 unctior cena.
46. fundata, ‘based upon,' not quite ‘invested in’: the meaning seems to
be that no man is in this case considered wise and fortunate, unless all can see
from his handsome marble (nitidis) villas how firm is the basis on which his
financial prosperity restS. Cf. Cic. p. C. Rab. Post. 1. 1 ,fortunas fundatas atque
optime constitutas. The wealthier Romans possessed a surprising number of
country seats. Cicero was never accounted a very rich man; but he had
fourteen or fifteen, eight of them of considerable size and beauty.

EPISTLE XVI

The tone adopted in line 17 seq. makes it pretty clear that the Quinctius
who is addressed was younger than Horace. The Eleventh Ode of Book ΙΙ is
addressed to a Quinctius Hirpinus, who is probably the same man. He
appears to have already attained conspicuous success in his ambitious career;
and may possibly be identified with Τ. Quinctius CrispinuS, the consul of
9 B.c. The date is uncertain.

1-16. I will tell you αΖΖ about my Sabine estate, Quinctiu3‚ that you may not
have the trouble of askinq me as to its produce. It lies in α shady valley : the
climate is 910οά, trees abundant, and the stream as cool and clear as the Hebrus.
This deur and charminy retreat keeps me in health even in autumn. 1. ne ε
not imperative, but dependent on scribetur line 4. 2. arvo ε properly land
prepared for corn, but not yet sown z cf. Varro, R. R. l. 29. 1 seyes dicitur quod
aratum satum est ,· arvum, quod aratum necdum satum est .· but the word is
commonly used for corn-land generally. opulentet: a rare word, found
for the first time here. 3. an pratis : Bentley restored an. from vet.
Bland. and other good MSS. et pratis would join two substantives not
more closely connected than any other two in the list. amicta :
cf. Od. 4. 5. 30 11. 4. forma, ‘ nature ' or ‘character': Varro, R. R. 1. 6. 1
formae cum duo yenera sint, una, quam natura dat, altera, quam satimzes
imponunt etc. loquaciter: ie. with all the fulness of a proud owner. For
recent descriptions of the estate cf. Martin’s Horace 2. 233 3 Antiquarian
Magazine, June, 1883 ; Milman's Life of Horace 101 ; G. Boissier Prmnenades
Archeoloyiques vol. 11. pp. 1-62. The main point at issue is whether the
farm lay on an elevated plateau near Rocca Giovane (as Rosa thinks), or on
the right bank of the Digentia, two or three miles further up the valley‚ opposite
to the village of Licenza. The latter view is far more probable.

5. continui montes: not quite, as Conington, ‘in long continuous lines
the mountains run ’ ε there are no marked mountain chains in this part of the
Sabine territory, but rather a broad continuous mass, broken only by the valley
of the Digentia, running from north to south. The most conspicuous of these
mountains is the Monte Gennaro (4163 ft.), rising high above the rest as seen
from the plain of the Campagna, and this was probably Horace’s Lucretilis.
ni, ‘ except that ' τ with continui we must understand sunt ; a general
statement is made, and then a qualification is introduced, which modifies it
(Roby 1574, S. G. 654). The full expression of the thought would be ‘the
mass of the hills is unbroken, at least it would be, supposing they were not to
be parted by' etc. Kiessling (with Keller) accepts the si of some MSS. and
places a comma aster vaporet, making temperiem laudes apodosis to si . . .
dissocientur, which he explains as ‘ a subjective representation,' like si . . .
