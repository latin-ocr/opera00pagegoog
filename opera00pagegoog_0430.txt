SATIRE V
SUBJEGT 2-—A Journey to Brundisium. ΒΑΤΕ, 38 or 37 B.c.

Horace gives an account of a journey to Brundisium in company with
MaecenaS‚ Cocceius, Fonteius Capito, Virgil, Plotius Tucca, VariuS‚ and the
rhetor Heliodorus. Of these the first three joined Horace and Heliodorus at
Anxur: the others at Sinuessa. The poem is interesting, but 011 the whole
disappointing: considering the company he was travelling in, it is wonderful
how little Horace has told us worth remembering. It is written in imitation
of Lucilius, who in his third book described a journey from Rome to Capua,
and thence to the Sicilian strait. The occasion of Horace’s journey was an
embassy on which Maecenas and Cocceius were sent (line 29), probably that of
Maecenas to Athens, in the autumn of 38 B.C., to meet Antony there. ln that
year Octavian had suffered two severe defeats from the ficet of Sex. Pompey,
and the people were becoming unruly, and refused to pay taxes. Accordingly
he sent Maecenas to Antony to arrange the subjects in dispute between them.
Appian 5. 92 δεινὸς δὲ ὢν ἀεὶ τὸ συμφέρον συνιδεῖν, ἔπεμπε Μαικήναν ἐς
Ἀντώνιον, μεταδιδάξοντα περὶ ὧν ἔναγχος ἐπεμέμφοντο ἀλλήλοις, καὶ ἐς συμ-
μαχίαν ὑπαξόμενον. Maecenas was successful in his attempts at conciliation,
and in the following spring (ἀρχομένου ἣρος) Antony set-sai] from Athens to
Tarentum with 300 ships, to give Octavian the help he had asked for. The
embassy here mentioned cannot refer to the negotiations which Maecenas
carried on between Octavian and Antony at the so—called peace of Brundisium,
B.c. 40, for (1) it is certain that Horace was not known to Maecenas at that
time (2. 6. 40); (2) the treaty of Brundisium, which was arranged by Maecenas,
Cocceius, and Pollio, is referred to in 11110 29 as a thing of the past—aversos '

this respect the London of the ancient world. Its population has been
estimated at over a million at the beginning of the empire. With mighty
Rome and its tumult is contrasted Aricia with its little inn. excepit and
accepit are both well-supported and good readings. accepit, ‘entertained,'
is, however, made more likely by the addition* of hospitiog cf. 2. ‘6. , 3
Cic. ad Att. 2. 16. 4 te iu Arpinati mdebimus et hospitio ayrcsti accipiemus cx-
cipere is joined with hospitio sometimes, but not so commonly. Aricia, La
Riccia, 160 stadia=20 Roman miles distant from Rome, according to Strabo,
was celebrated for the worship of Diana, her priest being a runaway slave,
who had slain his predecessor3 cf. Macaulay‚ Lays of Ancient Rome ‘ From
the still, glassy lake that sleeps Ι Beneath Aricia's trees 3 1 The trees in whose
dim shadow Ι The ghastly priest doth reign: 1 The priest who slew the slayer,

Ι And shall himself be slain.’ 2. hospitio modico, ‘in a little inn.’
For this use of hospitium, cf. Cic. Seu. 23. 84 ex vita ita discedo tamquam ex
