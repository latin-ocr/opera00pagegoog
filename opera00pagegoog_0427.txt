52. numqui Pomponius. The reply of Horace. The dissolute Pom-
ponius, if his father were alive, would be rated by him 111 just the same terms
as the prodigal in the play3 proving that the language of every-day life and
of comedy are the same. Pomponius is not mentioned elsewhere. qui:
the use of this form with comparatives is so common that Keller rightly
prefers it to quid of many MSS. 3 cf. Plaut. Aul. Prol. 16 ecqui maiorem filius
mihi honorem liaberet. 54. puris . . . verbis: plain, simple language.
Quint. 8. 3. 14 purus sermo et dissimilis curae. 56. personatus . . .
pater, ‘the father in the play,' wearing the mask of a father. 58.
tempora certa. modosque, ‘ a regular beat and rhythm.' 60. non, with
invenias line 62, ⁶ you would not find 111011111118 of the dismembered poet, as you
would if you were to take to pieces ‘⁶ After foul discord bra-st the iren-bound
poste ancl qaas of war.” ' The line is from Ennius and imitated by Virgss, Aen.
7. 622 belli ferratos rumpit Saturnia postes, In both passages the opening of the
temple of J anus in time of war is referred to. 62. etiam, to be ι10111061 to
disiecti, ‘ tossed in different 1113008,’ which rather refers to membra than to
its noun poetae. Horace seems to have had the fate of Orpheus pictured to
his mind through 1110 811111131· fate of Pentheus. Eur. Bacch. 1135 seq. πᾶσα
δ’ ᾑματωμένη Ι χεῖρας, διεσφαίριζε σάρκα Πενθέως. Ι κεῖται δὲ χωρὶς σῶμα, τὸ
μὲν ὑπὸ στύφλοις Ι πέτραις, τὸ δ’ ὕλης ἐν βαθυξύλῳ φόβῃ, Ι οὐ ῥᾴδιον ζήτημα.

65. Sulcius and Caprius were two informers (quadruplatores, 1101 elela-
tores, as the schol. calls them, for the delatores belong 10 13101 1111108), who
are here depicted as carrying in their hands their informations (libelli accusa-
torii)‚ hoarse with speaking and declaiming in the actions they bring: the
highwaymen are afraid of them, but a quiet man of spotless character need
have no sear of either. 68. puris manibus, ‘ with hands pure from guilt,'
i.e. from blood-guiltineSS. Cf. καθαρὸς χεῖρας Her. 1. 35 3 καθαρὰς χεῖρας Αο8011.
Eum. 313. 69. ut 818 tu, ‘even supposing yon arel 70. non ego
sim, which has much more MS. authority than sum, is borne out by Horace’s
usage of the 11010111131, especially with negatives z ‘ Ι never can be like an in-
former.' Cf. ¹ next line: nulla taberna habeam lffiffn'isme paeniteat
sanum patris huius. It is a mistake to regard these as optatives.

71. taberna: 3 general name sor a shop‚ here a book-shop. pila:
taberna; cf. Mart. 7. 61. 5 nulla catenatis pila est praecincta laqoenis, of a
wine-shop 3 0311111. 37. 2 a pileati-3 nona fratribus pila, where Ellis says pila
‘ was the pillar or column in front of the taberna, used to indicate the occupa-
tion of the possessor? columnae, A. P. 373, means the same thing. Books
(volumina) were, in the 0380 of a bookseller’s shop, probably tied to these
pilae, and it was there that the vulgar turned over and thumbed them.
Horace, at the time of writing this satire, one of his earliest, had not the
intention of publishing his writings‚ which Maecenas probably afterwards
persuaded him to (10. Ηο wrote for writing's sake, and for the· appreciation
of his friends; cf. line 73. 72. Hermogenes Tigellius. Cf. 1. 2. 33
3. 3. Does Horace hint that Hermogenes was too mean to buy books, and
got what he could by turning them over at the pilae? 73. recito: to
recite was a necessary preliminary to publication at Rome, and a sort of pub-
lication in itself. By such recitations Horace’s fame was first created, and
reached the ears of Maecenas. But Horace did not, when he wrote 11118 831110,
intend 10 go beyond recit'mg, and he did not even recite Talao, lme 23. For
