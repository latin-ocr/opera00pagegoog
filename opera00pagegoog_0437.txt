SATIRE VI

Horace, the Freedman’s Son. Darii, ’ἒ 36 B. 0.

The intimacy between Maecenas and Horace, a freedman’ s son, exposed
the latter to jealousy. The last Satire especially, wherein he figured as one
of Maecenas’ s chosen companions in the Journey to Brundisium, made people
say that the minister was making too much 01 6 parvenu. This Satire is
written in reply to these obtrectatores. It has a double scope: a defence of
Maecenas, and a defence of Horace himself. Maecenas is praised (1-18) 101
1101 looking down on those of humble birth ; and those who censure him are
reminded first, parenthetically‚ that Maecenas did not extend his intimacy
except to those of free birth ; and secondly, that all history supplies precedent
for his behaviour. From 20 ad fin. the Satire is a most elever ‹leprecation of
censure levelled at the poet himself. Horace in effect says: 'I know my
place3 Ι 6111 1101 going to thrust myself for-ward like Tillius, the upstart (24-
44). Ι 6111 6 freedman's son ; Ι 6111 1101 ashamed 01 11 ; and 11, as I hope and
believe, I won Maecenas's esteem by merit, it is to my freedman father that I
owe all the merit Ι possess (65-99). Ι repeat, Ι 6111 1101 going to thrust myself
«into stations beyond my place: I have neither the ostentation nor the mean-
ness of Tillius (103-109). My 1116 and habits are those of a quiet Roman
gentleman; and Ι have no ambition for anything beyond’ (111-131). The
only indications for fixing the date are the fact that his friendship with
Maecenas, which began about 38 13.c.‚ is now of pretty long standing (olim,

line 54). On the other hand, he is not yet in possession of his Sabine farm,
which he received about 34 or 33.

ancestors were the noblest among the Lydians who colonisecl Etruria.’

half the Lydians emigrated with the king’s son Tyrsenus and settled in Italy,
in the territory called after him Τυρσηνίη, Etruria. Lydorum quidquid :

ancestors held the consulship, we must take leyionffius of the Etruscan hosts.

custom 01 giving pedigrees with the mother’s, not the father’s name. 4.
