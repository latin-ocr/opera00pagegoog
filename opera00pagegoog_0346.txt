ODE XXVII

‘ Βίας] yuilty travellers start with evil omens or be stopped by them: for
those Ι am anxious about I shall carefully search out happy auyuries. And
may you especially, Galatea, have yood luch, and yet Ι dread from experience
that stormy channel passaye. Y ou must be as bold as Europa was, when she
trusted herself to the bull .· what a difference she found between flowery meadows
and mid ocean! And when she reached Crete how she reyretted her boldness‚
and prayed for death s Venus however at last consoled her.'

Horace uses the occasion of Galatea’s Journey as a pretext for introducing
the story of Europa, which was a favourite with the Gk. lyrists and had been
dealt with by Stesichorus, Simonides, and Bacchylides ; see Kiessling.

1. inpios . . . (7) ego. Note the antithetical words at the beginning of

each sentence. parrae recinentis, ‘ of the hooting owl's refrain ' ; recino
seems to refer to the repetition of the cry. 2. ducat, ‘conduct,' i.e. on
their journey. 3. rava: see Epod. 16. 33 n. Lanuvium was on a hill

(cf. decurrens) near the Appian Way, along which travellers for Brundisium
and Greece would pass. 5. rumpat . . . ‘ and let a snake break their journey
when begun, if darting like an arrow across the road it has scared the horsesss
Editors find difficulty in these simple lines. Orelli says rumpat=interrumpat
and adds ‘ scilicet ita ut huic omini scelerati non pareant . . . ideoque pereant,’
thus making rumpat really mean ‘let it warn them in vain to break‚' which it
' can hardly do. Bentley reads rumpit, which has little authority, and makes
the lines merely contain a statement as to what is an evil omen on a journey, a
thing which every one knew. The sense simply is ‘ Let evil omens accompany
the guilty when they start on Journeys and (i. e. in other instances ; in
English we use ‘ or ') let them have their Journeys interrupted by them.’ 7.
mannos. Of. Ep. 1. 7. 77 n. cui=ei cui, ei going with suscitabo, cui
with timebo. 8. auspex: from avis and spicio, one who ‘ watches birds‚'
deduces omens from their fiight.

9. stantes, ‘ stagnant.’ 10. imbrium . . . ‘the bird prophetie of
impending storms,' cf. 3. 17. 12 where the raven is called aquae auyur, and
the same bird is probably meant here, cf. Virg. G. 1. 388 tum cornix plena
pluviam vocat inproba voce. For imbrium divina cf. divina futuri A. P.
218 ; Virg. Aen. 6. 66 praescia venturi, and 1. 15. 24 n. 11. oscinem:
oscines aves quae ore canentes faciant auspicium, Festus ; but Kiessling from
ob(s) and cano, cf. ostendere=obstendere. 12. solis ab ortu, i.e. from the
region of light and happy omens. 13. sis licet . . . ‘mayest thou be
happy, yes happy, where'er thy choice, and live . . .' licet :per me licet,
‘as far as I am concerned you may‚’ i.e. though regretting your departure,
still I do not wish you ill but well. Most take sis as dependent on licet, but
it seems better to make it parallel to vivas, licet being purely parenthetical.
15. laevus: clearly: ‘ill-omened,' σκαιός. The Roman augurs faced the
S„ the Greek the N .‚ when taking observations, and, as the Roman poets are
sometimes imitating a Greek phrase, sometimes using a native one, when they
speak of an omen ‘on the left hand‚' the context is the only guide whether
they mean from the E. or from the W„ of good or evil omen. ·

17. sed. Vides . . . ‘but you see with what uproar Orion hastens to his
setting.' Orion sets early in November when the storms of winter begin.
18. ego . . . Emphatic3 Horace speaks from sad personal experience.
‘I know what the dark gulf of Hadria is, and the crimes of the clear South
