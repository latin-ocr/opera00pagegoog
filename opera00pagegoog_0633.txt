189-192. A play must be of due Zenqth, and the intervention of α deity must
not be needlessly employed. 189. quinto actu: Greek tragedies were
divided into a πρόλογος, ἐπεισόδια, and an ἔξοδος, divided by choric songs (cf.
Aristot. Poet. 12), but the number of the ἐπεισόδια was not always the same.
In the Oedipus Tyrannus for instance there are six ‘ episodes ’ (cf. Jebb p. 8) ;
111 the Oedipus Coloneus there are five. The establishment of the rule requiring
three acts (nam trayoedia in tria diffiditur, expectationem, qesta, exitum .-
Donat. on Ter. Adelph. 3. 1), or including the prologue and the epilogue five,
has been assigned to Varro (cf. Ribbeck, Rom. Trag. 642). It was quite
unknown to the comio dramatists ; the division of each of the plays of Plautus
and Terence into five acts is due only to the grammarians, and is often very
unskilfully made, being perhaps due only to this dictimi in Horace. Still there
were no doubtpauses in the action of most, if not of all plays ; and these were
filled up by the music of the fiute-player ; cf. Plaut. Pseud. 1. v. 160 (at the
end of Act) tibicen vos interea liic delectaverit. Cicero knew a division into
three acts 3 cf. ad Quint. fr. 1. 1. 16. 46 illud te ad extremum et oro et hortor,
ut tanquam poetae boni et actores industrii solent, sic tu in extrema parte et
conclusione muneris ac neyotii tui diliqentissimus sie, ut hic tertius annus
iinpe'rii tui tanquam tertius actus perfectissimus et ornatissimus fuisse videntur.
The justice of the ‘five-act’ rule has been often, and not without reason,
disputed z and some of the greatest modern playwrightS‚ especially among the
French, prefer the division into three acts. 190. spectanda reponi, ‘ to
be reproduced as deserving to be seen.’ spectata (= ⁸ after being once
seen ³) is easier but has less MS. authority.

15. 11 φανερὸν ὅτι καὶ τὰς λύσεις τῶν μύθων ἐξ αὐτοῦ δεῖ τοῦ μύθου συμβαίνειν,
καὶ μὴ ἀπὸ μηχανῆς. In the nine plays of Euripides where the deus ee:
machina appears, ‘the distinct purpose is to bring the action to a peacesul
close, and calm the minds excited and disturbed with the calamities, and still
more the apparent injustices, suffered by the actors' (Mahaffy, Euripides 122).
In the Philoctetes of Sophocles the appearance of Heracles ex machina is
needful in order that the struggle between two human wills, neither of which
could yield without an inconsistency fatal to the dramatic picture, might be
terminated by an expression of the divine will. 192. quarta . . . persona:
tragedy began withadialogue between a single actor and the leader of the chorus ;
Aeschylus introduced a second actor, Sophocles a third (Arist. Poet. 4. 16 καὶ
τό τε τῶν ὑποκριτῶν πλῆθος ἐξ ἑνὸς εἰς δύο πρῶτος Αἰσχύλος ἤγαγε . . . τρεῖς
δὲ καὶ σκηνογραφίαν Σοφοκλῆς), employed also by Aeschylus in his later plays,
i.e. in the trilogy of the Orestea. These three actors formed a troop, and one
troop was assigned by the archon to an approved dramatist. loqui laboret,
‘show anxiety to speak.'

193-201. Thepa‘rt of the chorus in traqedy. 193. actoris partis . . .
defendat ι the chorus should not stand outside the action of the piece, and
simply fill up the intervals between the soenes with songs slightly, if at all,
connected with the plot (ἐμβόλιμοι) as often in Euripides and especially in
Agathou, but should take as direct a part in it as an actor does, Aristotle
