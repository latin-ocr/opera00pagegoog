and in the following lines words are used, which certainly point to the censor’s
fonctions: splendor is a word especially applied to the orolo equester (e. 9.

the personification of the verba which has been suggested by the metaphor
of the censor, and perhaps too by honore indigna. 114. versentur
intra penetralia Vestae ε (1) Schiitz (after Porph. iol est, domi) takes this to
mean simply the privacy of the poet’s own house, from which the poems are
not yet sent forth by publication ; and accounts for the unusual expression by
saying that the poet is regarded as the keeper of a shrine. He thinks the
point to be that the poet is to exercise a severe criticism upon his writings
before entrusting 1110111 to the general judgment. But it is doubtful whether
penetralia Vestae could thus be used of a. private house, even though there

objects‚ accessible only to the , Vestals and the Pontiffs, and carefully
guarded from the eyes of the multitude: they were kept in the pcne-
trale of the temple, shut up in earthen vesseIS, and were regarded as the
piynora imperii (Livy 26. 273 Ovid, Fast. 6. 359, 439). The most famous
among these was the Palladium: but there were also other divine figures

there is no positive evidence that he temple of Vesta. had the privileges of an
asylum. But the notion of a sacred protection was always associated with the

free ; and their intercession carried the greatest weight (Preller, Rom. Myth.
540). Hence it is not too much to assume that those in danger might have’
recourse to the temple for at least temporary protection. So Conington, ⁶ And
