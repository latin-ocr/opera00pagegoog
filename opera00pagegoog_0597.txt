ludos ipsos ,· S. 1. 1. 97 se non umquam servo melius vestiret ,· Virg. Aen. 1.
15 quam Iuno feriar terris massis omnibus unam coluisse. This usage with an
adverb seems limited to poets.. 198. nimio has more authority than
mimo, being supported by vet. Bland. and good MSS. It is also doubtful
whether mimus can be used, as Orelli says, ‘pro quovis histriones and it is
not easy to see why Horace should not have used the plural sor the actors
on the stage. For plus nimio cf. note 011 1. 10. 30. 199. asello surdo:
Horace has packed two proverbial expressions into one, for the sake of greater
emphasis: cf. Ter. Haut. 2. 1. 10 ne illc nauscit quam mihi nunc surdo
narret fabulam, and Zenob. 5. 42 ὄνῳ τις ἔλεγε μῦθον · ὁ δὲ τὰ ὦτα ἐκίνει · εἰς
ἀναισθησίαν τινῶν ἡ παροιμία εἴρηται.

202. Garganum: cf. od. 2. 9. 6. The forests of Garganus have now
almost entirely disappeared, as is also the case very largely in the Apennines.
203. ludi, i.e. ludi scaenici, not ludi circenses, to which there is no reference
here. artes, ‘works of art ' ι 1. 6. 17. 204. oblitus, ‘bedizened’ 3 cf.
Milton, Par. L. 5. 356 ‘ besmeared with gold.’ The word is used in the sense
of ‘ overloaded ’ in Cic. ad Her. 4. 11. 16 si crebrae conlocabuntur (emor-nationas),
oblitam reddent orationevm· Cic. Brut. 13. 51. 206. sane emphasising nil,
‘not a word.’ 207. veneno, ‘ drug‚' ic. dyc. The purple (murem) of
Tarentum was considered second only to that of Tyre (Pliny, H. N. 9. 39. 63).
‘ At the spot called Fontanella is the Monte di Chiocciole (snail-shells), a hill
entirely formed of the 3110113 used in making the purple dye '—Hare, Southern
Italy 332. The wool of Tarentum was also famous ; cf. Od. 2. 6. 10.

208-213. Ι am not speakinq from any disinclination to the theatra .· a gyreat
dramatic poet seems to me a true maqician. 208. me laudare maligne,
‘that Ι am niggardly in my praise.’ 210. per extentum funem . . . ire,
a proverbial expression for anything difficult: cf. Arrian, Epict. 3. 12.2 δύσκολόν
ἐστι καὶ τὸ ἐπὶ σχοινίου περιπατεῖν· καὶ οὐ μόνον δύσκολον, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐπικίν-
δυνον. 211. inaniter, ‘by illusionS,' ie. without. any real cause for it all.
Exactly so used in Cic. Acad. 2. 11. 34 cum sii incertum, vere inaniterque
moveam& ib. 15. 47 cum animi inaniter moveantur eodem modo rebus cis,
quac nullae sint ut eis quac sint} where Cic. is representing the κενοπάθεια 01·
διάκενος ἑλκυσμός of Sextus ; de Fin. 5. 1. 3.

214-218. Lei other pocts too have a share in your patronassc. 214. et
his, ‘ to these too ' : et is not used after aye as a simple copulative, but always
has the force of ‘also ' 3 cf. Mayor on Nat. Deor. 1. 30. 83. 215. fastidia
ferre: cf. Virg. Ecl. 2. 14 Amaryllidis . . . superba pati fastidia. superbi,
‘fastidious‚’ as in S. 2. 2. 109 ; 6. 87. 216. redde, ‘give ’ as due, not ‘give
back ’ ; cf. Od. 2. 7. 17 11. munus Apolline dignum: cf. 1. 3. 17 n.

219-228. Thac we do not cnjoy this more often, is clue to our own intra-sive-
ness, susceptibility‚ anti vanity. 220. ut vineta caedam mea: evidently
a proverbial expression, though not found elsewhere. But cf. Tibull. 1. 2. 98
quid ‘messes uris acerba tuas? Horace good-humouredly includes himself in
the number of the pestering poetasters, though no one could have been more
free from the faults which he here describes, than he was himself. 223. loca,
used, for„ metrica] convenience, for locos ‘passages‚' the form always used in
prose in this sense. Conversely loci is occasionally used in poetry (Lucr. 4.
509; Virg. Aen. 1. 306; 2. 28, etc.)‚ once 111 Livy (5. 35. 1) and often in
Tacitus in the sense of ‘places' for loca. ini-evocati, ‘though not en-
cored ’ z for the ‘scenio ’ use of revocare cf. Livy 7. 2 Livius . . . cum saepius
revocatus vocem obtudisse& Ov. Am. 3. 2. 73 sed enim revocate, Quirites, Ι ct
