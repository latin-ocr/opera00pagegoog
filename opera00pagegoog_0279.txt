5. Tibur. For the same sentiment with regard to Tibur, cf. 1. 7. 1-21.
Argeo: Ἀργείῳ in Latin lettere, long ‘ e ’ answering to ‘ec’ Tiburtus, son of
Catilus‚ is said to have come with Evander from Greece. colono is what
Kennedy calls a ‘Recipient Dative, instead of an Ablative of the Agent‚’
used after the Part. Pass. or after gerundives ; cf. below, Laconi Phalantho,
and 1. 6. 1 n. 7. sit modus . . . ‘Ohl may it be the final bourn 1 To
one with war and travel worn,'—Martin. The genitives go both with modus
(=‘a limit ¹) and with lassus, for which cf. Virg. Aen. 1. 178 fessi rerum,
the gen. seeming to be dependent on the sense of ‘having had enough of ’
which the word contains, If Horace was at Actium (see Epod. 1 Intr.) then
13.c. 27 may well be the date of this Ode, whereas he could hardly describe
himself as ‘ weary of war ' with reference to Phjlippi fifteen years before.

10. pellitis ovibus Galaesi. The Galaesus was a river near Tarentum
famous for a choice breed of sheep, whose wool was so valuable that they
were ‘covered with skins ' (pellitae) to protect it from injury. 11. reg-
nata Phalantho, ‘ruled over by Phalanthus.' requam: ‘ to reign‚' being
intransitive, ought not to have a passive, but for convenience sake the past part.
is used passively3 cf. 3. 29. 27 ‘regnata Cyro ‚· Virg. Aen. 6. 794 regnata Saturno.
For the foundation of Tarentum circ. B.c. 700, see Class. Dict. s.v. Phalanthus.

13. ille . . . ille (21) . . . ibi (22). Notice carefully the guiding
wordS. 14. angulus terrarum, ‘corner of the world,’ not so much
implying that Tarentum was in a ‘corner of the world' as that it was
a snug nook for retirement. For ridet cf. S. 1. 5. 90 11. ridet mihi: lit.
‘ smiles to me ' = takes my fancy. non Hymetto mella decedunt,
‘the honey does not give way before that of HymettuS.' N either Latin nor
Greek has a use of the pronoun similar to the word ‘that ' in the above
sentence: they are therefore obliged either to say ‘ the honey does not
give way before the honey of Hymettus,’ or to take a short cut (compendium,
whe'nce the phrase comparatio compendiaria applied to this idiom) and avoid
such roundabout method by saying .‘the honey does not give way before
Hymettus.’ So below baca Venafro, and Hom. Il. 17. 51 κόμαι Χαρίτεσσιν
ὁμοῖαι ‘looks like those of the Graces.' Cf. also 2. 14. 28 mero . . . pontffl·
cum potiore cenis ; 3. 6. 46 aetas parentum peior avis, 15. decedere is
commonly used of one who quits the footpath to make way for another: ‘ yield
to.' Here, however, where certem follows, the notion is rather of a vanquished
competitor quitting the arena. 16. baca, ‘ the berry ' par excellence, i.e.
the berry of the olive. 18. Iuppiter, τῖε. the god of the atmosphere, cf. 1.
1. 25 11. brumas: ὂηινια-τότευίηῑα, i.e. ‘the shortest day‚' then generally
‘winter.' Aulon: a valley (αὐλών) near Tarentum3 cf. Mart. 13. 125
felioc vitibus Aulon. 19. Falernis: cf. 2. 3. 8.

21. te mecum. The two words are side by side, even as the two friends
were to be. ille locus, i.e. the district near Tarentum. The words et
beatae arces complete and specialise ille locus, arce-3 referring to the hilly
character of the district and beatae to its fertility. 22. tu: emphatic.
calentem, πλε. when the ashes were being removed from the pyre to the urn.
It was customary to sprinkle them with perfumes and wine (cf. Virg. Aen. 6.
226) ; the poet naturally prefers ‘the homage' of a tear. 23. debita : not
‘ due by custom,’ for’custom ordained the sprinkh'ng with persumes‚ but ‘ due
to our friendship,’—‘ the tributary tear! 24. vatis amici ε emphatic at
the end. Horace has a double claim (cf. debita) on Septimius’ tears: (1) their
long friendship, (2) the fact that that friendship had been hallowed by the
