M. Lolliae, consul Rc. 21, had been defeated by the Sygambri 13.c. 16 (see
4. 2. 36 n.)‚ but stood high in the favour of Augustus, who sent him 13.c. 2
as tutor with his grandson O. Caesar into the East, where he died, according
to Vell. 2. 102 by his own hand in consequence of the roguery and
rapacity he had long practised being discovered. He was certainly very
wealthy, and his granddaughter Lollia Paulina the wife of Caligula some-
times wore Jewelry worth over 1:300‚000 (cf. Pliny N. H. 9. 118 hic est rapi-
narum exitus, boc fuit, quare M. Lollius infamatus requm muneribus iu toto
oriente interdicta amicitia a Gaio Caesare Auyusti filio‘ venenum biberet, ut
neptis eius quadringentiens H S. operta spectaretur). But what his real char· ’
aeter was, and whether Horace was deceived in him (as Lucretius was in Mem-
mius) or no, is unimportant‚ for the concluding lines of the Ode, though pro·
fessing to describe Lollius, are really the description of' an ideal. Lollius was
the friend of Augustus, and Horace having to send him an Ode and praise his
virtues, naturally finds it easier to pen a sketch of perfect virtue instead.
Odes, Dedications‚ Testimonials‚ and the like more often present the writer’s
idea of what a man should be, than a description of what a particular man is.
