20. surpuerat. By syncope for surripuerat, cf. 1. 36. 8 n. 21. felix
. . . ‘happy (i.e. in the possession of my beart) after Cinara (i.e. after her
death) and a beauty of repnte (uota) and winning wiles (yratarum artium).'
gratarum artium is simply a gen. of quality (cf. 4. 1. 15 centum puer artium),
and is put instead of an adj„ being strictly parallel to nota. facies refers to the
whole personal appearance of Lyce. Most editors make artium yratarum
dependent on nota=‘noted for,' and et=etiam, ‘and a beauty noted also for
her winning wiles.’ That et after que can=etiam certainly lacks proof, and
the construction notus artium they only support by the authority of 2. 2. 6,
where see notes. The yratae artes are explained by Comm. Cruq.‚ ‘ artium
yratarum facies dicitur quae oculis, nutu superciliorum, cervicis volubilitate,
capitis yratia, totius denique corporis matu placet! 24. servatura . . .

of a poor old raven.'

25. vetulae: used of old age when spoken of contemptuously. For the
age of the raven, cf. 3. 17. 13 n. 28. facem, ‘torch,' here of the blaze of
beauty which kindles the fire of love. For dilapsam (dis-lapsam) ‘that
has fallen asunder‚' i.e. gradually wasted away into ashes, some MSS. by a
common error read delapsam in cineres which would mean ‘that has fallen

down into ashes.’

ODE XIV

This and the following Ode are closely connected: the one dwells on
Augustus' victories in war, the other on his triumphs in peace.

‘How shall senate and people worthzly immortalise thy merits, O Auyustus?
But lately the Vindelici have been tauyht thy prowess in war, for it was with
thy troops and under thy auspices that Drusus overthrew the Genauni and the
Brenni, and that afterwards Tiberius joined battle with the Raeti. On him
every eye was fiaeed as he careered irresistible over the field of battle ,· like to the
South wind when he sweeps over ocean at the equinoae, or the bellowiny Aufidus
when with swollen torrent he threatens inundation‚ was the onset with which
he broke the mailed ranks of barbarians and, his own troops uninjured, carried
carnaye and conquest far and wide—yes‚ because thou didst furnish the forces,
the forethouyht and the favour of the yods. For it was fifteen years from the
clay when Alexandria yielded to thee that fortune added this erowniny ylory to
thy past campaiyns. Now all the world owns thee its master at peace beneath
thy sway, lwhile Italy and Rome enjoy thy quardianship and thy presence.’

Tiberius (emperor A.D. 14-37) and Drusus (4. 4 Intr.) were the sons of Tib.
Claudius Nero and Livia, who subsequently married Augustus. The campaigns
referred to took place in B.c. 15: Wickham says that ‘ their obJ'ect was to
obtain military command of the more eastern passes into the valleys of the
Rhine and the Inn which were still unsafe for Roman armies. Drusus forced
what is now known as the Brenner pass, overthrowing the Rhaeti near
Tridentum, now Trent. Meantime Tiberius was despatched from Augustus'
army in Gaul, with the purpose of taking the enemy in the rear. He ascended
the Rhine valley to the lake of Constance, and thence penetrated the gorges
of the Upper Rhine and Inn in every direction, so that at the conclusion of a
brilliant and rapid campaign, the two brothers had effected the complete
subjugation of the Grisons and the TyroL’
