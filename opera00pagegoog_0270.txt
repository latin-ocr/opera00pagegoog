comoedia). 11. ordinaris=ordinaveris, ‘ shalt have set in order,’ i.e. duly
arranged in your history, cf. St. Luke i. 1 ‘ Forasmuch as many have taken
in hand to set forth in order (ἀνατάξασθαι) 6 declaration.. .' grande

. . cothurno, ‘thou shalt resume thy glorious task on Cecropian
buskin,’ i. e. you shall resume writing tragedies worthy of the (1181111)Γ of
the Athenian stage. 12. Cecropio, because at Athens all the great Greek
tragedies were produced. cothurno: the tragic actors wore 111811- heeled
buskins to add to their height and dignity ; comic actors wore the low soccus
οἶᾝῇῖδτ. Virgil also (Ecl. 8. 10) alludes to Pollio's tragedies as sola
Sophocleo tua carmina diqna cothurno.

13. insigne praesidium: in apposition 10 Pollio: ‘ Ο 111011 illustrious
defence.’ maestis reis alludes to Pollio's skill in forensic eloquence‚ or, as
we say, ‘at the bar' ; consulenti curiae to his success as a speaker in the
senate, as a parliamentary orator—a very different style of eloquence. 14.
consulenti, ‘ deliberating‚' not ⁶ consulting you,’ as it would be absurd to
speak of 6 great body consultiny one of its members however distinguished.
curiae, ‘the senate,' cf. 3. 5. 7. 16. Delmatico triumpho. In Β.0. 39
he triumphed over 1116 Parthini, an Illyrian people near Dalmatia.

17. iam nunc . . . Horace suddenly represents himself as listening
to Pollio’s history, in which he knows beforehand events will be so 'vividly
and dramatically portrayed that he will imagine himself to be actually
seeing and hearing that which is described. cornuum . . . litui: see
illustrations in Smith’s Dict. of Ant. litui strepunt, ‘the clarions bray.'
18. perstringis aures. strinyo (cf. στραγγεύω, ‘strangle ’) means ( 1) hold
in a tight grip, and (2) graze 01· scrape the edge or surface of anything (the
idea perhaps being that when a thing is gripped tight and then pulled away
its surface suffers), cf. stringere arbores, rmnos, yladium. Hence perstrinyis
aures describes a loud harsh sound which grates upon the ear and deafens it ;
cf. praestrinyere aciem of a flash of light which passes over the surface of the
eye so as 10 dazzle it. 19. iam fulgor . . . vultus, ‘now the flash of
arms scares into flight the horses and the faces of the horsemen ’—-a singularly
bold but effective sketch of 6 cavalry rout dashed off by a master-hand in
half 6 dozen words. fugaces is proleptic; the sudden flash of weapons
in front of them frightens the horses 30 11161 they take to ssight. Of. J ob
xxxix. 22, 23 (of the horse)‘ He mocketh at fear and is not affrighted, Ι
Ν6111161· turneth he back from the sword: Ι The quiver rattleth against him,
Ι Τ116 ylitterz'ny spear and the shield.' 20. equos equitumque: effective
assonance: so in English ‘ warrior and war-horse,’ and Tennyson, Charge of
the Light Brigade, ‘While horse and hero fell.’ equitum vultus. Many
refer to a story (Plut. Caes. 45) that at Pharsalia Caesar ordered his soldiers
to strike at the faces of the young Roman nobles who formed the cavalry,
and that they fearful for their beauty turned and fied. The phrase needs
no such unnatural explanation. Horace says not ‘horsemen,’ but ‘faces of
horsemen‚’ because he wishes to bring vividly before our minds the pale panic-
struck faces of men flying for their lives: it is a brilliant dramatic touch,
not 6 recondite allusion to an obscure story.

21. audire magnos . . . audire which governs both duces and cuncta
subacta can by 113611ι 1116611 6111161· ‘hear ' or ‘ hear of ² 3 with cuncta subacta
it can only mean the latter, and there is consequently a strong pre-
sumption that it is to be taken in the same way with duces. ‘ Ι seem to hear
of mighty generals begrimed with the glorious dust of battle and of a whole
