ODE XV

⁴ When I thouyht to tell of wars and warlike conquesta Phoebus struck his
lyre to warn me ayainst venturiny on so wide a sea. And indeed, Caesar, the
most ylorious triumph of thy life is the establishment of universal peace. Peace
hath her victories no less than war, the checkiny of licence, the banishment of
vice and the restoration of the old virtues that made the name os Italy famous
to the limits of the world. Safe beneath thy yuardianship we sear war neither
at home nor abroad, ancl therefore every clay, when youny and old meet at the
family boarol, it shall be our cleliyht, aster prayer to the yods, to siny of the
ylorious dead, to siny of Troy and-Anchises, and of thee the last ancl yreatest
os that heaven-descendat racc?

1. Phoebus: as the god of song and music. So also he restrained
Virgil, though in a more homely manner, Ecl. 6. 3 cum canerem reyes
et proelia, Cynthius aurem Ι vellit et· admonuit. 2. increpuit lyra:
increpo means (1) ‘ to make a noise,’ (2) ‘to make a noise at‚’ ‘rebuke loudly‚’
and is therefore used accurately here: ‘ soff-QQQJ Ovid,
A. A. 2. 493, describes the same thing: ec eyo cum canerem, subito mani-
festus Apollo Ι movit inauratae pollice fila lyrae. 3. parva Tyrrhenum.
Note the antithesis, cf. 3. 3. 72 mayna modis tenuare parvis; according to his
universal practice of preferring the special to the general, Horace selects the
Tyrrheno sea as an instance of a wide or large sea. 4. vela darem,
‘spread my sails': for the same metaphor, cf. Virg. G. 2. 41 pclayoque
volans da vela patenti. Caesar. Augustus was a ⁶ Caesar ' as the adopted

son of Julius Caesar: but the name was gradually becoming a title, as it
has become in many modern languages, (3.9. Kaiser, Czar, Shah.

5. fruges . . . i.e. by making it possible to again cultivate the fields in
safety. 5-16. et. Note the repetition of et emphasising the accumulation
of blessings, and contrast the repetition of non 17-24. 6. et signa . . .
cf. 1. 2. 22 11. nostro: because Jupiter Capitolinus was the god of
Rome, cf. Prop. 3. 11. 41 ausa Iovi nostro latrantem opponere Anubim. 8.
vacuum duellis, ‘ free from wars.' For the form duellum cf. Ep. l. 1. 6 n.

62-146 and Dict. sv. The word is the maso. form of Diana (Ianusszanus),
and probably was originally the title of the sun. In Italy, however, he is
always represented with two headS, and the patron of gates (ianuae), inas-
much as they look two ways, while the term Ianus is applied to any ‘covered
way ’ or ‘ arcade ' with two entranccS. The name Ianus Quirini or Ianus
Quirinus was however specially applied to one such arcade, the doors of
