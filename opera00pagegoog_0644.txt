had not been taken.

librarius, ‘ a copying clerk,' a slave set to this employment by his owner in
order to produce books either for his own library or for sale ; cf. Marquardt‚
Ro'm. Privatalt. 1. 157. 355. quamvis, ‘however much ': for the con-
struction cf. Ep. 1. 16..6 ; 17. 1. 22. et citharoedus: Bentley (followed
by most editors) read. ut, which is good in itself‚ but has very slight authority.
357. multum cessat, ‘often neglects his duty ' : cf. Ep. 2. 2. 14. Choe-
rilus : cf. Ep. 2. 1. 232. 358. bis terve, ‘ twice, or even thrice,’ whereas bis
terque (line 440) is ‘twice, ay and thrice ': the former=raro, the latter:

mitat Homerus: the Greek grammarians and philosophers delighted to
discover inconsistencies and errors in Homer, most of all Zoilus, known as
Ὀμηρομάστιξ The connexion of thought in et idem . . . seems to be
‘ If a poet commits but few faults‚ these can be overlooked. If 116 is always
blundering, we ridicule him, even when to our astonishment he occasionally
goes right. But if he is to be judged. by a high standard, then even occasional
slips annoy us, although after all he ought to be pardoned for them, if his task
is a long one.' 360. operi longo ε so most good MSS. Some have opere

Cicero de Orat. 1. 26. 118 explains why we are such severe critics of those arts
which exist only to give us pleasure, and which miss their end altogether if
they fail to do SO. 370. diserti, strictly speaking not so strong as
‘eloquent' (cf. Cic. Brut. 5. 18 M. Antonius . . . disertos ait se vidisse
multos, eloquentem omnino neminem), but here practically equivalent to it.
