Tantalus, Tithonus and M inos .· Pythaqoras too, though he proved his soal
immortal, and in thy jadfflnent was no mean expounder of crath. But indeed
the yrave awaits us all, soldiers and sailorS, young] and old: crud Prosevpine
shwinks from none (1-20). So too I have been drowned. But do thou, Ο
sailor, not qradcye to cast a little sand upon my unburied corpse ,· so may qood
fortune ever attend thee. Surely thou canst not carelessly incur a crime which
will briny a curse on thy children and perchance on thyself. Τ hougth thou art
in haste the delay is bm'ef‚· east but three handfuls of earth and then thou
mayest pass upon thy journey.'

There would seem to have been a' so-called tomb 01 Archytas on that
Matine shore with which Horace from its neighbourhood to Venusia (01.
Venusinae 11110 26) would be well acquainted„ and he makes this the scene 01
1113 Ode, which is 0 monologue, the speaker being the spirit of some traveller
who had been shipwrecked near the Archytas-tomb and left unburied. Lines
1-20 are reflections suggested by the sight of the great philosopher’s last
resting-place ; at line 21 the speaker first refers 10 himself, and appeals 10 011
imaginary sailor (supposed to be passing along or near the shore) to bestow
on him those ‘three handfuls of dust ’ which constituted formal burial.

So most now take this Ode, which 1103 113 origin in that class 01 Epigrams
known as ἐπιτυμβίδια (Gk. Anth. VII.) in which the dead are introduced
addressing some advice or request to the living. It must be allowed however
that the connexion between the first and second half is loose‚ and many editors
have therefore taken the Ode as a dialoyue between 0 sailor who finds it
and the unburied corpse of Archytas. Some assign only 1-6 10 1110 301101,
0111013 make Archytas begin to speak line 17, or line 21 which ’13 1110 111031
natural point 101 0 break. Against this—(1) Lines 3 and 4, which certainly
on the face of them say that Archytas was buried, must mean something else,
for in line 36 110 says that he is not buried. (2) Except 3. 9, which is not in
point, no other Ode shows any trace of dialogue. (3) What authority is there
for the fact that Archytas was drowned 2 cast ashore 011 1110 Μο11110 1100011 and
unburied? (4) If he was, why should Horace write this Ode about a man
he cared nothing for, who had been dead 400 years, and„ even if unburied,
would have completed his 100 years 01 wandering 011 1110 banks 01 1110 Styx
(Virg. Aen. 6. 329) long before. (5) Is it natural to put the philosophica]
reflections 01 1110 opening lines into the mouth of a wandering 3011012

2. Archytas. A distinguished mathematician (mensorem maris . . . )
of Tarentum: lived about Rc· 400. He was of the Pythagorean school of
philosophy, cf. lines 10-12. 3. pulveris . . . There is an obvious eon-
trast between his boundless genius and 11011οπ tomb. Cf. Shak. 1 Henry 4,
V. iv, 89 ‘When that this body did contain a spirit, Ι Α kingdom
101 it was too small a bound; 1 But now two paces 01 the vilest earth 1 Is
100111 enough.’ Matinum: probably the shore at the 1001 01 Μ1. Gar-
ganus. 4. munera is technically used of the due and dutiful bestowal of
burial upon a empse, and seems to make the fact that Archytas is spoken 01
03 buried certain. These who make Archytas the speaker in line 36, where
he asks sor 11111101, 010 compelled here 10 explain ‘the gift of a little dust ’ as
though it meant ‘the want of the gift of . . . ‚’ and cohibent as=keep you
here on the coast, it being impossible for you to enter Elysium until you
receive the ‘three handfuls ’ 01 001111.
