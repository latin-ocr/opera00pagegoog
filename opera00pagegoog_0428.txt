79. inquit, ‘quoth one ' : aliquis understood. Some one says that

80. denique, ‘in short, is any one of my intimates your authority for it ‘3 ’

8. 20 n. The host often invited, for the amusement of himself and the rest
of the company, scurrae, men whose wits were sharpened by their appetites‚
who were expected to say smart things in return for their dinner. These
poor wits (quibus sunl verba sine penu el pecunia, Plaut. Capt. 3. 1. 12) had
scats on the third or imus lectus. Cf. Ep. 1. 18. 10 imi Ι derisor lecti. amet,
