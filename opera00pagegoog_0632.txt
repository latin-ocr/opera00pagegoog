604 HORACE ’ ARs

ι01033-810111οᾶ’; 01. S. 2. 5. 90. querulus: Arist. Rhet. 2. 13. 15 ὅθεν
ὀδυρτικοί εἰσιν καὶ οὐκ εὐτράπελοι οὐδὲ φιλογέλοιοι. laudator . . . ‘given
to praise the days he passed when a lad ' ; ib. ἓ 12 διατελοῦσι ’γὰρ τὰ ’γενόμενα
λέγοντες· ἀναμιμνησκόμενοι ’γὰρ ἥδονται. Like Nestor in Homer.

175. multa . . . adimunt: ⁶ anni venire dicuntur ad qnadrayesimnm
sextum nsque annum, inde abire iam accedente senecta '-—-Comm. Cruq. Cf.
Od. 2. 15. 14 ; Soph. Trach. 547 ὁρῶ ’γὰρ ἥβην τὴν μὲν ἕρπουσαν πρόσω, τὴν
δὲ φθίνουσαν. Τ110 phrase implies that there is a point up to which life
ascends, after which it descends, cf. Burns: John Anderson, my jo, John Ι
We clamb the hill thegither Ι . . . Now we maun totter down, John, etc. The
French say Un homme sur son retour. 176. ne forte, etc. You must
remember this, lest you should assign the characters Wrongly. Schu'tz and
Orelli 4 connects this with morabimur, not with adimunt: and certainly the
connexion of thought with line 178 13 closer than with line 175. For the rhyme
cf. line 99 note. 178. aevo goes with adiunctis as well as with aptis,
The adiuncta are according to Acron qaae bene haereant et conyrnant aetati :
:attributeS‚ τὰ καθ’ αὑτοὶ συμβεβηκότα, 01 ‘necessary accidentS.' Cf. Cic.
Acad. 1. 5. 21 quae beatae vitae adiuncta sunt, ‘ things inseparable from a happy
1110.’ apta indicates that the connexion denoted by adiuncta is a natural one.
aevo, ‘time of life,’ cf. Ep. 1. 20. 26; Virg. G. 3. 100 animos aevumque
notabis. morabimur, ‘ dwell with care upon.' ·

179-188. Thinys seen on the staye irnqoress tlze audience, more than thinys
reported : but there are some scenes not fit to be represented in action. 179.
in scaenis : the plural, used also in Virg. Aen. 1. 429 ; 4. 471 scaenis aqitatns
Orestes, seems to refer to the various occasions on which a play would be acted ;
‘ in theatres ' : it is apparently never used of a single stage. acta refertur:
as in the Greek tragedies by an ἄγγελος 110111το distance or an ἐξάγγελος 110111
the house before which the scene was laid. 180. segnius: cf. Cic. de
Orat. 3. 41. 163 facilius ad ea, quae visa, quam ad illa quae andita sunt, mentis
oculi feruntur. 181. fidelibus : cf. Herod. 1. 8 ὦτα ’γοὶρ τυγχάνει ἀνθρώ-
ποισιν ἐόντα ἀπιστότερα ὀφθαλμῶν. 182. ipse tradit: ipse mihi trado
qnod video ,· at atter mihi tradit qnod narrat—Acron. 183. dig-na geri:
01. Od. 1. 3. 25 11. promes: cf. Ep. 1. 1. 87 11. 184. facundia praesenS‚
‘ the eloquence of one who is now ·on the stage ' ι this is better than to take it
of one who witnessed the deed, as many editors do, for praesens is naturally
contrasted with ecc oculis.

185. nezz'va μή, not μή. 111 the Medea of Euripides, the eries of the
children, as they are being murdered ,behind the sceneS, are heard by the
audience (lines 1271, 1277) : the chorus tells J ason 01 their fate (line 1309), and
then Medea appears in 0 chariot drawn by dragons, with the bodies of the
children (line 1317). Ι11 Seneca's play, in spite of the rule of Horace, the
murder took place on the stage. 186. Atreus: 01. 11110 91. 187.

Procne, according to the Greek form 01 the story, was changed into a night· ,

Philomela the nightingale, and Pro ne the swallow, perhaps Wrongly connecting
the name of the former with μέλος. Cadmus in anguem ε cf. M. Arnold,
Empedocles on Etna ε Α11(1 there, they say, two bright and aged snakes, Ι Who
once were Cadmus and Harmonia, Ι Bask in the glens or on the warm sea-shore,
In breathless quiet, after all their ills. Cf. Eur. Bacch. 1330 seq„ where
Sandys remarks : ‘ In another play Eur. actually represented on the stage the
commencement 01 the change, as is shown by the following somewhat
