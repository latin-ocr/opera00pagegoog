284 HORACE BOOK 111

discords has sunl< to rest.' The length of the TroJan war was due to the gods
having taken different sides, and being therefore unable to decide what the
issue should be. seditiozse-d-itiO, ‘a going apart‚’ ‘ a dividing into two
factions ;' the Gk. στάσις. 30. protinus, ‘forthwith,' immediately from
now: from pro, and tenus, which implies succession, that which ‘holds ori'
(tenet) to a thing being that which comes immediately after it ; cf. continuus.
31. nepotem. Mars the father of Romulus was the son of J uno. 32.
Troica sacerdos. Rhea Silvia, see ClaSS. Dict. S.V. Romulus,

33. redonabo: only found here and 2. 7. 3, where it means ‘ to give back.'
Nauck rightly explains : ‘ I will give up to Mars who has a claim on him,' re
being used as frequently in reddo (cf. 2. 7. 17 11.). (3.9. a postman reddit
‚epistolam ‘hands it over to the person to whom it is addressed,' ‘ duly delivers
it.’ illum ego: notice the juxtaposition of these emphatic pronouns.
34. ducere, ‘quaff,’ 1. 17. 22 n. Most MSS. give discere. 35. adscribi
. . . deorum, ‘to be enrolled among the peaceful ranks of heaven.' adscribere
(see Dict.) is a technical word: ‘ add to the register,' ey. of citizens. In his
use of ordinibus Horace is thinking of the ‘rows' or ‘ranks ' of senators in
the Roman Curia. inire . . . ducere . . . adscribi, ‘ three successive
steps: the entrance, the cup of welcome‚ and the acceptance of the new civis
adscripticius (Cic. de N. D. 3. 39).'—Kiessling. quietis partly suggests an
antithesis to the continued struggle in which the race of Troy has hitherto
been engaged, partly refers to the Epicurean belief that the gods enjoyed a
‘ sacred everlasting calm,' unmarred by any care for human sorrow3 cf. 1. 34 Int.

37. dum, ‘so long as‚' ‘provided that,’ 1. 16. 26 11. 38. qualibet
. . . beati, ‘let the exiles reign and prosper in whatever quarter of the world
they will.' exsules, i.e. the Romans ,as descendants of the Trojans who had
been driven into perpetual ‘exile ’ from Troy: the word is employed with a
certain contempt, for with all her magnanimity Juno is not above the feminine
weakness of saying something unpleasant (cf. the sneer in peperit sacerdos, line
32, and observe the same thing in Lydia 3. 9. 21 and 22). 42. stet.
Emphatic both itself and by position. sto is used in preference to any of its
*compounds to express immovable fixity3 the smallness of the word is its
strength ; cf. 1. 16. 19 n. 43. triumphatis. The intransitive triumphare
has no passive, but Horace for convenience uses the past part. pass.=
‘triumphed over,’ ‘led in triumph.' possit, ‘be strong to.’ 44. ferox,

‘fiery‚' ‘warlike,’ in antithesis to triumphatis. dare iura, ‘impose laws on.'
For Medisz‘tlie Parthians,' cf. 1. 2. 51 11.

46. qua . . . Nilus, ‘where the intervening sea divides Europe from the
African, where the swollen Nile waters the fields.’ These words explain and
define ultimas oras .· the ‘ farthest coasts ' are the Straits of Gibraltar in the
W„ and Egypt in the E. 48. tumidus rigat arva, i.e. by its annual
inundation, on which the fertility of Egypt depends3 cf. Virgil’s careful
description (G. 4. 293), et viridem Aeyyptum oiiyra fecundat harena. 49.
aurum . . . dextra: a somewhat awkward stanza, in which a fresh condition
is imposed on Rome's exercise of empire, viz. that she shall be superior to the
lust of gold. ‘ More brave in despising gold left undiscovered—and so better
placed when earth hides it—than in amassing it with hands that seize for
human ends all holy things.’ The construction spernere fortior quam coyere
is a harsh extension of the use of the epexegetic infinitive ; the parenthesis et

. . cela-t adds needless complexity, and the necessary separation of coqere
from humanos in usus 15 unsatisfactory.
