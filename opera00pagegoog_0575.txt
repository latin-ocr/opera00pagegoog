upon a lofty eminence, is a village now called Cantalupo Bardessa, which is
Horace's Mandela, described by him as ‘ rugosus friyore payns ² from its losty
position. We may well fancy Horace, as he ambled along this road, observing

EPISTLE XIX

This Epistle recalls the tone of S. 1. 4 and 10. The epistolary form is
more completely than elsewhere in this book a mere form 3 but it is natural
that Horace’s scorn of his imitators and rejoinder to his critics should be
addressed in the first instance to his patron Maecenas. The letter cannot be
earlier than the publication of the first three books of the Odes: otherwise
there is nothing to fix its date. It is evidently separated by a considerable
interval from Od. 4. 3. 13-16, when carping criticism had been silenced by the
general recognition of the poet’s merits.
