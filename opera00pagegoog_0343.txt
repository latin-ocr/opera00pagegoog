14. nec cultura . . . Partly referring to the fact that, being a nomadic
people‚ they never stayed beyond a year in one spot, partly to the practice of
relieving (recreat) those who had done the work one year (defunctos labori-
bus) by substitutes (vicarii) who had meanwhile acted as combatants but
who now had to take their fair turn (sors aequalis) of work. See Caesar 1. c.
16. vicarius (from vices), ‘one who comes in turn‚’ ‘a substitute ' ε a ‘vicar'
was originally a minister appointed to do the work of a rectory of which the
monks enjoyed the main revenues. 18. privignis, ‘ the guiltless wife
spares (zze. treats with kindness) her motherless stepchildren.' Cic. frequently
uses temperare in this sense, e.g. sociis, superatis hostibus, amicis temperare.
The cruelty of stepmothers was proverbia13 see Dict. s.v. noverca, μητρυιά.
19. dotata. regit virum. The Roman poets frequently complain that
rich wives often proved truly ‘better halves ’ 3 Plaut. Aul. 3. 5. 603 Mart. 8.

quaeret, ‘ if he shall desire to have ²‘ Father of the cities '' inscribed beneath
his statues’ The title of ‘ Father ' (pater or parens) seems to have been not
unfrequently bestowed on benefactors by states and cities3 so Cic. bids his
brother deserve the title of parens Asiae, and an actual inscription is extant
referring to Augustus as parens coloniae. See too 1. 2. 50 n.

30. quatenus, ‘ in as far as,' ‘since,’ explaining postgenitia ‘he must
trust to posterity for fame since . . .’ 31. virtutem . . . ‘since we
jealously hate living worth (and) regret it when removed from our gaze!
32. invidi, as its position shows, goes with both the contrasted clauses. The

the commercial enterprise of sailors and shipowners as a flying in the face of
Provfflence, who meant the sea for a means of separation not communication.

42. magnum . . . ‘ (if) poverty (considered) a great disgrace urges men
to do and endure anytffing, and quits the steep path of virtue.' 43. quid-
