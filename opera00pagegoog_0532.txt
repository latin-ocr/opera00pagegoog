EPISTLE V

For Torquatus see Od. 4. 7 Intr. Horace invites the busy and wealthy
advocate to a simple dinnerwith him, if he can put up with the plain fare
which he will furnish. There is nothing to exactly determine the date of the
Epistle, but it must have been written (cf. line 4) at least a year or two, prob-
ably somewhat more, after the second consulship of Statilius Taurus in 26 B.o.

from Phidias, Pausiacus from Pausias), a faber lecterius at Rome, whose
couches were evidently not luxurious. recumbere, as in Od. 3. 3. 11 and
elsewhere, for the more usual accumbere. 2. omne generally explained as
‘ all sorts of,' ‘any kind that may be served up.’ But it is better to take it as
‘ nothing but,’ as in Cic. de Nat. D. 2. 21. 56 omnis ordo, ‘ nothing but order ’ :

8 medio sole), later than was usual, the ninth hour being that generally chosen
for dinner (1. 7. 70, 71 ; Mart. 4. 8. 6). A late dinner would be, according
to the Roman notions, a modest one3 just as a banquet which began early
was supposed to be a luxurious one (cf. S. 2. 8. 3). Torquatus would also have
time to finish his business, as in S. 2. 7. 33 Maecenas is too busy to dine before
the lamps are lit. Of. J uv. 1. 49 exul ab octava Marius bibit, Mayor's note.

4. iterum: sc. consule. T. Statilius Taurus was consul (along with
Augustus) sor a second time 111 26 B.c.‚ having been consul (suffectus) for the
first time in 37 B.c. In 36 B.c. he commanded a fleet against Sex. Pompeius
in Sicily 3 in 34 B.c. he received a triumph for successes in Africa ; at Actium
in 31 B. c. he commanded the land forces of Augustus3 and in 29 Β. o. he
defeated the Cantabri and other Spanish tribes. In 16 Β.0. 116 was left in
charge of Rome and Italy during the absence of the Emperor. iterum is the word
