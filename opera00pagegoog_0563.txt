nprsan XVI NOTES 535

23. unctis: food was commonly taken in the fingerS, forks being unknown
except for kitchen purposes, and spoons little used: cf. Ov. A. A 3. 755 carpe
67003 digitis. 24. pudor 11161113,“6 false shame!

25- 31. Praise only suited to Augustus you 70077ἷῶ refusa to take to yourself.
Why take credit for 77773άο70. aad virtue 2 25. tibi with pugnata‘ by you.
26. vacuas, ‘'open to fiattery3 called by Persius 4. 50 bibulas 7777763.
27- 28. tene . *Iuppiter a quotation, according to the scholiasts, from
the Panegyricus Augusti by L. VariuS, the tragic poet. 30. pateris . . .
vocari: a Grecism, cf. 1. 5. 15 and Od’. 1. 2. 43 patiens vocari Ι Caesaris ultor.

31· 40. The pleasare naturally derived from a reputation for virtue rests 077
770 37776 basis: aml unfounded 10767736 73 as worlhless as yroundless blame. 31.
sodes: cf. 1.1. 62 n. respondesne.. . 7.6, as Wickham puts it, ‘do
you virtually claim the title. '²’ The metaphor is derived from a levy or a
censue, where the citizen answers‚ when he hears 1113 own name called;
Livy 3. 41 edicitur dilectus: 7777770763 07οΖ nomina respondent. nempe admits
the justice of the implied assertion· . ‘to 116 sure I do, for’ etc. 33. qui:
sc. populus. 34. indigno: sc. 6777 deferantur fascea detrahet has
somewhat better support than detrahit. The illustration is not very suitable ε
for the 67070907770 imperii, although theoretically possible, was exceedingly rare.
35. ponezdepone ; Od. 3. 2.19 7766 sumit aut ponit 36677763 Ι arbitrio popularis
aurae. The object of pone is 1706, 1.6. nomen 71777 00777 el prudenlis; the
intervening mention of the fasces, being thrown in parenthetically by way of
comparison. If we take fasces as the object, we are compelled to give a forced
meaning to meum, ‘it is my prerogative to give and to take away offices':
besides, we lose the contrast between tristis and delector.

36. idem, 1.6. populus. furem: 36. 7776 esse. pudicum: always
in a,sense more restricted than our ‘chaste,’ of freedom from the worst forms
of vice. 37. laqueo collum . . . used for the extreme of villai11y‚ cf. od.
2. 13. 5 ; Epod. 3. 1. 38. colores ε 11111611 better supported than colorem.
Bentley admitted that the singular was much more common (cf. od. 1. 13. 5 ;
4. 13. 17), but held that the plural could be explained of the colour coming
and going, the man turning red, then pale, then red again. And this 13 probably
right. He quotes Prop. 1. 15. 39 qais te 60960677 mallos pallere colores? Lucian,
Eun. 11 παντοῖος ἦν ἐς μυρία. τραπόμενος χρώματα. So too Plato, Lys. 222 Β
παντοδαπὰ ἠφίει χρώματα. 40. medicandum ε unquestionably right,
being supported alike by the weight of MS. authority, and by the requirements
of the sense. The old reading mendaeem involves a false antithesis ε for there
13 110 reason why mendax infamia should terrify mendaces especially. The
genesis of this blunder 13 made clear by the various readings in the inferior
MSS. : a copyist’s slip must have given mendicandum by assimilation to mendace
and mendosam, and from this came by conjectura] correction mendacem and
mendicam. A mndosus requires 67770777ος 116 13 conscious of serious faults,
though not those which 6 mendax infamia ascribes to him.

‘mere exter-ml correctness of conduct. 41. qui servat: the definition of
the ‘good man ’ is that which would be given by the popular judgment, one
having in view only externa] rectitude of conduct, and a good reputation. But
Horace shows that these may go along with grave moral defectS, known to all
who are familiar with the man 63 116 really is. Schiitz well reminds us of
the Pharisees of the Gospels. consulta patrum, 7.6, 7116 111611 13 0077773 111
