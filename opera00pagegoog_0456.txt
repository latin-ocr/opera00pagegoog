Terentius Varro Reatinus, among whose numerous writings were the so-called
Menippean Satires, a medley of verse and prose. 48. inventore z Lucilius
2. 1. 63. 51. tollenda, ‘to be done away with,’ 01. 1. 4. 11.

52. doctus, i.e. does not your learning lead you to criticise mighty Homer?
53. comis, ‘ without acerbity’ 3 perhaps ironical, for Lucilius was noted for
his sarcastic attacks on preceding poets ; Gell. 17. 21. 49 clariorque tunc in
poematis eorum (i.e. 01 EnniuS, Pacuvius, Accius, etc.) obtrectandis Isucilius
fuit. mutat, ‘ alter-,² ‘propose to emend,’ ‘ censure.' Acci : Accius, the
famous tragediam born 170 B.o. (altus senex Ep. 2. 1. 56). 54. ridet:
as for example at the line 01 Ennius at tuba terribili sonitu taratantara discit
(Serv. on Aen. 9. 503), and at his sparsis hastis lonyis campus splendet et horret,
where Lucilius sarcastically proposed horret et αἱροῦ (Servius on Aen. 11. 602).
gravitate minores, ‘in dignity inferior ' to the demands of epic poetry.
55. cum de se loquitur, ‘without speaking of himself as superior to those
whom he has criticised.’ The sense is—‘Does he not criticise Ennius and Accius
without claiming to be their superior, just as I make no such claims when
criticising him ’.ἰ ’ Palmer, with Heindorf, takes n0n=nonne (and parallel to
nil, non above) ‘ when he speaks of himself is it not as greater than . . . ’ζ’

57. illius, only here in Horacez illius, eleven times. rerum, ‘ his sub-
Jectsff 58. factos, ‘highly wrought' ; Cic. de Or. 3. 48. 184 oratio polita
et facta quodam modo. 59. ac si, ‘than 11.’ The construction is z ac si quis
contentus hoc (ablat.) tantum, pedibus quid claudere senis, amet, etc., ‘than 11
any one content with this alone, namely‚ confining his subject in hexameter
verses, were to choose,' etc. claudere : 2. 1. 28. 62. Cassius Etrus-
cus, of whom we know nothing beyond this passage, wrote so much bad

poetry, that it was said his manuscripts and their cases served 101· fuel for his ¹

funeral pile. He must not be confounded with Cassius Parmensis of Ep. 1. 4.

⁴ 3, who was alive much later: he may have been a relative of his. 64.
ambustum generallyz‘scorched‚' is here=combustum‚ 01. Od. 4. ll. 253
Tac. Hist. 5. 12 maqna vis frumenti ambusta.

64. fuerit, ‘ grant that Lucilius was pleasant and witty.’ 65. limatior,
‘more polished.' 66. quam rudis . . . auctor, ‘than an inventor 01 a
new branch 01 poetry unattempted by the Greeks (might be expected to be).'
auctor can only be Lucilius himself, who is called the inventor 01 Satire
line 48 (cf. 2. 1. 63). Many, however (0.9. Orelli 4, Kiessling)‚ considering that
Lucilius cannot be compared with himself, take auctor to refer to Ennius 01· to
someone unknown to 'Horace whom he regards as the author of satire. In that
case Lucilius can only be spoken of in line 48 as the ‘inventor' 01 ‘ satire ’ in
a special sense, which excludes the loose ‘medleys' (saturae) of Ennius and
other poets. rudis is ‘new,' ‘unworked,' as rudis terra, ‘virgin soil‚’
Varr. R. R. 1. 27. 2; rudem Amphitriten, the ocean as yet unsailed on,
Catull. 64. 11. Graecis intacti: Quintil. 10. 1. 93 satira quidem tota
nostra est. 67. ille, Lucilius. 68. dilatus, ‘ 11 his life had been postponed.’
Most MSS. have dilapsus, which should mean ‘falling in pieces.' 69.
detereret: sc. lima, ‘would file off many asperities.’ 70. traheretur,
‘trailed.' 71. scab0‚ which smacks of the vernaculam, is twice quoted
from Lucilius, 296 (pluperf. sufferat), and 800 (eaput scabit). vivos, ‘to the

quick ' proleptic‚ 01. Pers. 1. 106 nee pluteum caedit nec demorsos sapit unques. ’

72. stilum vertas, the reverse end 01 the stilus was flat for the purpose
of smoothing the wax 011 the tablet‚ and obliterating what had been written 3
