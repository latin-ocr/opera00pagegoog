ODE XXV

An imitation of a Greek dithyramb. The poet represents himself as in-
spired by Bacchus, but also suggests that his state of poetic exaltation is due
to dwelling on Caesar's exploits, which, he says, he shall shortly celebrate
with no mere mortal utterance as he follows 111 the train of the god.

1. tui plenum, tle. inspired3 cf. 2. 19. 6 11. 3. velox mente nova,
‘ hurried on with new thoughts ' ; ἐνθουσιάζων. quibus antris: either
local abl.-- ‘in what caves 2 ’ or, which is more poetical, the dat.‚=‘by what
caves shall Ι be heard‘z’ 5. aeternum . . . ‘planning to set the glory

of Caesar for ever amid the stars and the council of Jupiter.' In mythology
glorified beings are represented as rewarded with a place among the stars.

ing,' their compositions : hence meditans inserere . . . ‘rehearsing the placing

yet by other lips shall be my theme.' Ν otice the vigorous asyndeton (οι-συν-
δέω) by which the three adjectives are left without any connexion.

8. non secus . . . libet. He compares his feelings as he is hurried
along by stream and grove to those of a Bacchanal who stands on a hill-top
gazing over the valley of the Hebrus and snow-clad Thrace right away to
Rhodope in the distance: the effect of the scene with both is to excite poetic

feeling. The construction is non secus . . . ut, though non secus is usually
followed by 0⁶03 but cf. l. 16. 7 aeque . . . ut. 9. Euhias: fem. adj.=‘a
Bacchanal,' cf. 2. ll. 17 11. exsomnis: because these Bacchic revels were

held at night and the Bacchanals were constantly νυκτιπόλοι, dvm-voc, etc.
