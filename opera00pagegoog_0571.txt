EPISTLE xv111 NOTES 543

eloth (cilicium .· cf. Acts xviii. 3), is properly to be called wool or not.
According to the Roman jurists it was.

16. propugnat . . . ‘takes up arms and fights in defence of trifles.’
Others harshly join nuyis amatus, ‘ maintains his own view, with no other
weapon than nonsense.’ scilicet ut, ‘to think that ² : this phrase occurs

five times in the Epistles, but nowhere quite in this sense. Perhaps, as scilicet
is very rare in interrogative sentences, we should read scilicet ε ut . . . i.e. ‘to
be sure ἔ the notion that ’ etc. If so, for ut sii? cf. S. 2. 5. 18 utne teyam?
non sit mihi . . . ‘I should not be believed before every one else.² 17.
vere with placet, not with elatrem‚ which is already provided with acriter.
18. sordet : cf. 1. 11. 4. Some put a comma after elatrem, making ut non
sit and ut non elacrem both depend on sordet, in the sense of ‘ on the condition
that‚' but this is very awkward. The abruptness of the text is much more
pointed. ‘ I would not care to have my life over again at that price.² 19.
Docilis has much the best MS. authority, and is found elsewhere as the name
of a freedman. The other reading Dolichos, ‘ Long,' would be suitable enough
as the name of a gladiator, if it had more authority. 20. Minuci via:
from Strabo (quoted S. 1. 5. 6 n.) we learn that there were two roads
froin Beneventum to Brundisium, one, the Appian mad, passing through
Tarentum, and better adapted for carriages‚ the other adapted only ‘ for mules,'
passing through Herdonia, Canusium, and Egnatia. The latter was that taken,
by Maecenas and his suite on the journey described by Horace in S. 1. 5.
Mr. Bunbury (Dict. G. 2. 1282 A) thinks it ‘not improbable ² that this was
the Via Minucia: Schiitz (on S. 1. 5. 77) states the same view positively3 if
Kiessling's reading ἡ Μινυκία for ὴμιονική in Strabo is right the point is settled.

21-36. A rich friend wilc not tolerate vice, yamhliny, vanity, or ostentation
in one beozeath him, even though, he is by ‘no means free from saulis himself ,-
and tlae wish to make a show my lead to min. 21. damnosa, ‘ ruinous ⁷:
cf. 2. 1. 107 damnosa libido. praeceps, ‘fatal ' ε cf. Pers. 5. 57 hunc alea,
decoquit, ille in Venerem putria 22. gloria, ‘vanity ²: κενοδοξία, which
leads a man to spend too much on dress, etc, 23. argenti: the close
parallelism to auri sacra fames (Virg. Aen. 3. 57) and the like, strongly points

to the meaning ‘money.’ Some, however, give ‘ plate ' (as 1. 6. 17 ; 16. 76 3 2. 2. .

181), urging that the character described is reproved not for greed of money,
but for wishing to make as much display as a far richer man. inportuna,
‘ insatiata? 25. decem vitiis instructior cannot be ⁶ furnished with
ten times as many defects‚' as some translate: decem is merely a definite
number chosen for the sake of vividness, instead of the indefinite ‘many,' as
we might use ⁶ a dozen ' ; cf. A. P. 365 ; Plaut. Mero. 2. 3. 11 ita animi decem
in pectore incerti certant. The ablative is that of measure after a comparative,
‘better equipped (than you) by ten defects.' 26. regit, ‘ schools him.’

28. prope vera, ‘pretty nearly true ' : cf. 1. 6. 1.

30. arta toga, ‘ a toga of little breadth.' The toga was of an oval form,
and folded, as a rule, along the greater axis of the ellipse. Hence in wearing
it the breadth would be measured from the shoulders downwards ; and a toga,
if too broad, would either trail or have to be arranged in elaborate folds. For
a trailing toga as a sign of conceit cf. Epod. 4. 8. comitemzclientem.
31. Eutrapelus, a name given to P. Volumnius, a Roman knight (to whom
Cicero addressed ad Familiares 7. 32 and 33) on account of his polished wit.
Cf. Ar. Rhet. 2. 12. 16 ἡ ’γὰρ εὐτραπελία πεπαιδευμένη ὕβρις ἐστίν, Eth.
Nic. 2. 7. 13 and 4. 8. 10, where εὐτραπελία is defined as the J'ust mean
