left to persons to whom the testators were in no way related. Cicero notices
the practice of legacy·hunting in his own day; Parad. 5. 2. 39 hereditat-{s
spes quid iniquitatis in seniendo ‘non suscipit? quem nutam locupletis orbi
senis ‘non observat? loquitur ad voluntatem: quicquid demmtiatum est facit,
act-sectatur, adsidet, munerat. Horace himself classes legacy-hunting as 3
regular profession, to be set beside others, like contracting and money-lending,
cf. Ep. 1. 1. 77. Sen. de Benef. 6. 38 speaks of it as a recognised calling,
qui captandorum testamentorum artem professi sunt .· and so Pliny, Η. Ν. 14.
1. 5 captatio in quaestu fertilissimo. Juvenal is full of references to it : see
especially 5. 131 seq„ 12. 93 ad fin. To be childless and rich was to be
courted‘and powerful: Plin. l. c. orbitas in auctoritate summa. Some rich
men actually disowned their children, in order to gain the attentions that
orbitas attracted, 8311. ad Marc. 19. 2. In order to turn his lamp on this
remarkable feature of Roman society, Horace introduces Ulysses in consulta-
tion with the shade of the Theban seer Tiresias in Hades. He is supposed to
continue his conversation with him at the point where it is concluded in the
Odyssey‚ 11. 149. There Tiresias had told Ulysses of the wanderings and
perils yet in store for> him, and how he would return to Ithaca after them
all ε here Ulysses asks him how he is 1ο repair his broken fortuues when he
1133 reached Ithaca, and Tiresias bids him become a toady on some rich old
man, in the hope of becoming his heir ; and an admirable description of the
arts of the legacy-hunter is given in the form of precepts as 1ο 1113 best
manner of obtaining success in that profession, reminding one 111 this respect
of Swift's Directions to Servants.

3. quid rides ι Tiresias had smiled at the assurance of Ul ysses in asking
for more. doloso is n0t=tibi doloso, but is the third person: so Con.‚
‘and yet it craves for more, that heart of guile.' 4. revehi, ‘to sail
back ²: vehi regularly used thus: hence, rather anomalously, vector, ‘a pas-
senger! 5. nulli quicquam mentite: Tiresias was a Greek ‘true
Thomas.’ Soph. Oed. Tyr. 298 ᾧ Ι τάληθὲς ἐμπέφυκεν ἀνθρώπων μόνῳ : Antig.
1092. 7. apotheca (ἀποθήκη) 111 Latin acquired most usually the sense of
‘wine-cellar,’ though the Roman wine-roem was in the upper part of the
house3 Od. 3. 8. 10 n. From apotheca comes the Italian botteqa, Spanish
bodeya, French boutique. procis : generally of the μνηστῆρες of Penelope.
8. re, ‘money,’ the one thing] needful ; cf. Ep. 1. 1. 65 rem, Ι si possis, recte,

si non, quocumque modo rem. vilior alga est z a proverbial comparison ;
Virg. Ecl. 7. 42 proiecta vilior alya ,· Od. 3. 17. 10 alqa inutili.

9. missis ambagibus, ‘to cut the matter short} ‘in plain word8‚’ ἁπλῷ
λόγῳ. 10. turdus: the thrush, or fieldfare, was esteemed a great delicacy,
Ep. 1. 15. 40 ; 5. 72. Martial 13. 92 gives it the first place among birds.
11. privum (zproprium) dabitur: a phrase used by Lucil. 21 ad certam ad-
ducam et primum hisee abdomina thurini Ι advenientibus priva dabo cepha-
laeaque achai-nae. Cf. Ep. 1. 1. 93 priva triremis ,· J uv. 8. 68. The transition
of privus from its original meaning of singulus to that of proprius is easy.
devolet, to be rendered literally, ‘let it fly away,' referring to the thrush.
12. nitet after illuc ubi defends nequeunt in the last Satire, 87, after iltis
. . . quae. poma: cf. Ep. 1. 1. 78. 13. honorae, ‘glories' such as
fine fruits‚ flowers, vegetables3 Od. 1. 17. 16 ruris honorum. 14. ante
Larem: first-fruita were offered to the Lares3 cf. Tib. 1. 1. 13 et quodcum-
que milii pomum nomas educat annus Ι libatum ayricolae ponitur ante deo.
