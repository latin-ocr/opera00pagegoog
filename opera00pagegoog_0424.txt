1. Eupolis 446-410, Cratinus 519-422‚ Aristophanes 448-380 B.0.‚ are also
mentioned together as true satirists by Horace's imitator, Persius 1. 123 au-

2. alii. Among the other most famous poets of the old comedy are Crates,
PherecrateS, Teleclides, Hermippus, Amipsias, Phrynichus, and Plato, The
old comedy dated from 460 to 404 3 its characteristic was the most unsparing

6. hinc omnis pendet Lucilius, ‘ Lucilius is entirely derived from
them.' The satire of Lucilius certainly discharged the same function among
the Romans as the Old Comedy did among the Greeks, the function of public
criticism on public men which in our days is discharged by the press. But as
Quintilian says that Roman satire is wholly original (10. 1. 93 satira tota
‘nostra esi), Sellar considers (Roman Poets p. 219) that Horace here only
points out this parallelism. Palmer, however (see his Preface), holds that
Horace ‚clearly describes Lucilius as copying the Old Comedy, and that Quin-
tilian's words must refer to the outward form rather than to the inward
substance of Roman satire. O. Lucilius was a Roman knight, of good
family and fortune, great-uncle of Pompey the Great: he served under
P. Africanus in the Numantine war, and was the intimate friend of that
general and Laelius; he died 103 Ro. He wrote thirty books of Satires:
the first twenty and the thirtiethin hexameters ; the twenty—second apparently
in elegiacs3 the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh in trochaics3 the twenty-
eighth and twenty-ninth in iambics, trochaics‚ and hexameters. We possess
about 1100 lines of his in fragments. 7. mutatis tantum pedibus.
Hor. here ignores those of Lucilius' satires which were written in iambics and
trochaica and what is more important, ignores the absence of the dramatic
form. facetus, ‘ humorouS.’ Of. Cic. Leg. 2. 15. 37 Aristophanes facetis-

Quod tollere possis, putat. As far as we can judge from the fragments preserved,
perhaps most people now would agree with Horace, not with Quintilian, on
the literary question. 12 garrulus, of dictating, as loquaa· 1. 1. 13.
This line naturally follows the train of thought interrupted by the three
lines, 9-11, ¹qarrulus taking up facetuS, emunctae uaris, and durus. Every
conceivable plan for bringing the verse into more strict syntax has been
reverted to by German critics. Schiitz puts a comma at erat, making it personal :
