Cic. Acad. 2. 29. 93. civicus is poetical for civilis (cf. Od. 2. 1. 1 3 3. 24. 26),
like hosticus (Od. 3. 2. 6) 101 hostilis ; it is not used by Cicero, except in the
technical phrase civica corona. 24. amabile, ‘ charming‚’ with no direct
reference to amatory poetry, though doubtless including this, 25. hederae :
for ivy as the reward of poets cf. Od. 1. 1. 29 11.

applications whether hot or cold‚ cf. Suet. (Aug. 81) who says that Augustus

Musa. curarum is gen. 01 material (Roby 1304, S. G. 523) ; the curae
form the frigida fomenta which serve to chill the ardour of the soul and prevent
it mounting on high where ‘ heavenly philosophy leads.' The curae themselves
are the ‘ cares ' mentioned in the preceding 111105, viz. the study of rhetoric, law,

or even of poetry (cf. the silver age use of curae=literary work), for all these -

studies hinder the true philosophie aspirations of the soul. Some take curarum
as obJ'ective genitive, fomenta as ‘ remedies‚’ and translate friqida ‘feeble,’
‘ powerless.’ But this is very 1101511, and also leaves it quite obscure what is
meant by ‘ the unavailing remedies against cares ' which Florus is to abandon.
28. opus: the task assigned (ἔργον), studium the chosen pursuit (προαί-

the sewing up of a wound, which, if it does not heal, win break open again ε
sarcire is the technical term for surgical sewing, and coire for a wound j0ining

discindendae. ‘You must write me word of this too, whether you make as
much of Munatius as you should. Or does your mutual regard‚ like an ill-
sewn wound, join to no purpose, and break open again, and does some cause—
be it your hot blood, or your ignqrance of the world—chafe you wild as you
are with your untamed necks ’ζ’ 33. rerum inscitia, ‘ ignorance of the
world.’ 35. indigni rumpere, ‘ 't were shame to break the ties, which
made you once sworn brethren and allies '—Conington. For the inf. cf. Od.
