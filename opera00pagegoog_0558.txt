EPISTLE XV

'l'his Epistle must have been written after the famous physician Antonius
Musa had brought the cold-water treatment into fashion by his cure of
Augustus in the year 23 B.c. ; and probably not long after. Horace writes to
a friend, who is called in the MSS. inscriptions C. Numonius Vala, to tell him
that he cannot spend the coming winter, as he had previously done, at Baiae,
and to make enquiries about Velia and Salernum. He humorously compares
himself to a certain Maenius who liked to have the best of fare, when he could
get it, but put up readily with plain dishes, when nothing better offered.

Veliae: a town of Lucania founded by the Phocaeans, when driven out of
Corsica, where they had for a time found a home after the destruction of
Phocaea, about 540 B.c. Its Greek name was Ὑέλη 01· Ἑλέα. 11 was a
prosperous commercial town, and was noted for its excellent climate, so that
Aemilius Paullus», the conqueror of Perseus, was sent there by his physicians
when suffering from a troublesome disease (Plut. Aem. 35). Not long after
its foundation it became the seat of the famous Eleatic School (Xenophanes,
Parmenides, Zeno). Salerni: a Campanian town delightfully situated
on the north shore of the modern gulf of Salerno. It was of much importance
in the Middle Ages, and still has a populationbf over 2Ο,ΟΟΟ. 2. via:

mended the former to Horace, who therefore had no need to resort to the
vapour baths over the sulphur springs at Baiae. tamen: although it is
